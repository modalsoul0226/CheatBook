## Overview

- **Paul-Michel Foucault** (15 October 1926 – 25 June 1984) was a French philosopher, [historian of ideas](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/History_of_ideas), writer, political activist, and [literary critic](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Literary_criticism).

- Foucault's theories primarily address the relationship between [[Power]] and [[Knowledge]], and how they are used as a form of [[Social Control]] through societal institutions. Though often cited as a [[Structuralism|structuralist]] and [[Postmodernism|postmodernist]], Foucault rejected these labels. His thought has influenced academics, especially those working in [communication studies](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Communication_studies), [[Anthropology]], [[Psychology]], [[Sociology]], [criminology](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Criminology "Criminology"), [cultural studies](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Cultural_studies), [[Literary Theory]], [[Feminism]], [[Marxism]] and [[Critical Theory]].
