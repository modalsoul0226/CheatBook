## Modern and Pre-Modern Punishment

- Foucault begins by outlining the contrasts between modern and premodern approaches. There are four major transitions:

	1. Punishment is no longer a public display, a spectacular demonstration to all of the sovereign’s irresistible force majeure, but rather <u>a discrete, almost embarrassed application of constraints needed to preserve public order</u>.
    
	2. <u>What is punished is no longer the crime but the criminal</u>, the concern of the law being not so much what criminals have done as what (environment, heredity, parental actions) has led them to do it.
    
	3. Those who determine the precise nature and duration of the punishment are no longer the judges who impose penalties in conformity with the law, but the ‘experts’ (psychiatrists, social workers, parole boards) who decide how to implement indeterminate judicial sentences.

	4. The avowed purpose of punishment is no longer retribution (either to deter others or for the sake of pure justice) but <u>the reform and rehabilitation of the criminal</u>.

##  Carceral Archipelago

- Foucault does not deny that no longer ripping criminals apart is an advance. But the darker converse of the ‘gentler’ way is its penchant for total control.

	- Premodern punishment violently assaults the criminal body, but is satisfied with retribution through pain; <u>modern punishment demands an inner transformation, a conversion of the heart to a new way of life.</u>

- But this <u>modern control of the soul is itself a means to a more subtle and pervasive control of the [[body]]</u>, since the point of changing psychological attitudes and tendencies is to control bodily behaviour. As Foucault puts it, for the modern age, ‘the soul is the prison of the body’ (<span class="title">Discipline and Punish</span>, 30).

- The most striking thesis of <span class="title">Discipline and Punish</span> is that the disciplinary techniques introduced for criminals become the model for other modern sites of control (schools, hospitals, factories, etc.), so that <mark>prison discipline pervades all of modern society</mark>. We live, Foucault says, in a ‘carceral archipelago’ (<span class="title">Discipline and Punish</span>, 298).

## Docile Bodies

- Disciplinary training is distinctive first because <u>it operates not by direct control of the body as a whole but by detailed control of specific parts of the body.</u>

- The focus is not merely on the results to be achieved, of seeing that, one way or another, the soldier does what we desire.

- The point is rather to achieve the results <u>through a specific set of procedures</u>.

	- We don’t just want you to shoot the gun at the enemy; we want you to hold it just this way, raise it to your shoulder this way, sight down the barrel this way, pull the trigger this way.

	- In short, it’s a matter of <mark>micro-management</mark>.

- Foucault sums up the modern approach to discipline by saying that it aims at producing ‘docile bodies’: <u>bodies that not only do what we want but do it precisely in the way that we want</u> (<span class="title">Discipline and Punish</span>, 138).

## Hierarchical Observation

> #art/architecture 

- Hierarchical observation is based on the obvious fact that <u>we can control what people do merely by observing them</u>.

- Previously, architecture was an expression of the <u>privileged status of those in power</u>, either to <u>display their magnificence</u> (‘the ostentation of palaces’) or to give them a vantage point to <u>overlook their subjects or enemies</u> (‘the geometry of fortresses’) (<span class="title">Discipline and Punish</span>, 172).

- But modern architecture builds structures that fulfill the functional needs of ordinary people and at the same time ‘<u>render visible those who are inside</u>’.

	- So, for example, the tiered rows of seats in a <u>lecture hall</u>, or well-lit <u>classrooms</u> with large windows and wide aisles, not only facilitate learning; they also make it extremely easy for teachers to see what everyone is doing.

	- Similar techniques are at work in <u>hospital</u> rooms, <u>military barracks</u>, and <u>factory</u> work floors.

- All examples of ‘<u>an architecture that would operate to transform individuals</u>: to act on those it shelters, to provide a hold on their conduct, . . . to make it possible <mark>to know them, to alter them</mark>’ (<span class="title">Discipline and Punish</span>, 172).

## Normalizing Judgement

- <u>Individuals are judged</u> not by the intrinsic rightness or wrongness of their acts but <u>by where their actions place them on a ranked scale that compares them to everyone else.</u>

-  Normalizing judgment is a peculiarly pervasive means of control. There is no escaping it because, for virtually any level of achievement, the scale shows that there is an even higher level possible.

-  Further, norms define certain modes of behaviour as ‘abnormal’. <u>The threat of being judged abnormal constrains us moderns at every turn.</u>

## Examination

> A Normalizing Gaze

- Examination combines <a class="internal-link" href="#Hierarchical Observation">hierarchical observation</a> with <a class="internal-link" href="#Normalizing Judgement">normative judgment</a>. It is, Foucault says, ‘<u>a normalizing gaze that establishes over individuals a visibility through which one differentiates them and judges them</u>’.

- The examination is a prime locus of modern [[Power/Knowledge]], since it combines into a unified whole ‘<u>the deployment of force and the establishment of truth</u>’ (DP, 184).

- It both elicits the truth about those subjects (patients, students, job candidates) who undergo the examination and, through the norms it sets, controls their behaviour.

---

> Network of Writing

- The examination also reveals the new position of the individual in the modern nexus of power/knowledge. It situates individuals in a ‘network of writing’ (DP, 189).

- <u>The results of examinations are recorded in documents that provide detailed information about the individuals examined and allow power systems to control them</u> (for example absentee records for schools, patients’ charts in hospitals).

- The examination turns the individual into a ‘<mark>case</mark>’ – in both senses of the term: <u>a scientific example and an object of care</u> (and, of course, for Foucault, caring implies controlling).

---

> The Polarity of Visibility

- This process also reverses the polarity of visibility.

- In the premodern period, the exercise of power was itself typically highly visible (military presence in towns, public executions), while those who were the objects of knowledge remained obscure.

- But in the modern age the exercise of power is typically invisible, but <u>it controls its objects by making them highly visible.</u>

## Micro-Centers

- Society itself appears as a multitude of dominated others: not only criminals but also students, patients, factory workers, soldiers, shoppers…

	- <u>Each of us is</u> – and in a variety of ways – <u>the subject of modern power.</u>
	
- Correspondingly, there is no single centre of power, no privileged ‘us’ against which a marginalized ‘them’ is defined.

- <u>Power is dispersed throughout society, in a multitude of micro-centres.</u>

- This dispersion corresponds to the fact that <mark>there is no teleology</mark> (no dominating class or world-historical process) <mark>behind the development</mark>. <u>Modern power is the chance outcome, in the manner of genealogy, of numerous small, uncoordinated causes.</u>

## The Marginal

> Border of the Society

- <u>[[Marginalization|Marginalized]] individuals and groups are, unlike the mad, genuinely part of modern society</u>; they speak its language (even if with an accent), share many of its values, play essential social and economic roles.

-  <u>Their lives my be significantly defined by values that are counter to those of the social mainstream or they may belong to a group whose welfare is systematically subordinated to that of mainstream groups.</u>

---

> Political Programme (Without Total Overthrow)

- In contrast to the mad, the marginalized have values that can meaningfully challenge our own and needs that could be plausibly satisfied within our society.

- Their concerns can, therefore, be the focus of programmes for effective political action.

- Further, such programmes can be genuinely revolutionary without Utopian global ambitions.

	- For us to authentically say ‘we’ with the mad would require demolishing our core values and institutions, but <u>the claims of the marginal are based on critiques of specific features of our society that can be modified without total overthrow</u>.

---

>  De-marginalization / GIP

- It might seem that a politics of the marginal is itself just another instrument of marginalization, since it consists of ‘our’ claiming the right to speak for ‘them’.

- Foucault was well aware of this danger and insisted on political actions designed simply to provide opportunities for marginalized groups to speak and be heard.

- So, for example, the <span class="title">Groupe d’Information sur les Prisons</span> (GIP), which he, along with his companion, Daniel Defert, founded in the early 1970s, used Foucault’s status as an intellectual celebrity to attract media attention to prisoners who spoke directly on their own behalf.

- <u>Foucaultian politics</u>, as I am understanding it, <u>is the effort to allow the ‘errors’ that marginalize a group to interact creatively with the ‘truths’ of the mainstream society.</u>
