## Week 5: Musical Modernism and Russian Ballet

---
<h3>What is Modernism in Music</h3>

- In the 20th century, composers made a **radial break from the musical language** of their predecessors and contemporaries **while maintaining strong links to the tradition**.
  - Period just before and after WWI.
  - Critique of mass culture and easily digested art.
  - New musical aesthetics.
<br/>

**The First Modern Generation**
- Growing economy, new technology, and devastation of WWI had an impact on early 20th century composers.
- In the year leafing up to WWI, young modernist composers broke away from tonal harmonic language **while maintaining a strong connection to other aspects of tradition (e.g. form)**.
- Modernists sought to challenge the perceptions of their audience.
- However, they claimed tradition as their own, viewing their work as an extension of the work of past masters.
  - They believed that their work must engage with the past but offer something distinctly new.
  - This resulted in **radical recreations of past traditions**.
<br/>

---
#### Modernist Movements: Impressionism, Symbolism, Expressionism
- Changing views on human nature played an important role in shaping literature and the arts in the late 19th and early 20th century.
- A new conception of the human condition fostered new artistic movements that **questioned established styles and attitudes towards art**.
- **Definition: Impressionism**
    - Impressionism is a late 19th century movement in painting which artists **sought to depict an atmosphere from a position of detached observation** rather than realistically depicting the subject. 
    - Impressions of nature were conveyed with minimal brushstrokes and contrasting colours, **leaving the viewers' eyes to fill in the missing details**.
    - The effect of **light** was just as significant to the work as the subject
- **Definition: Symbolism**
    - Symbolism is a late 19th century movement in poetry in which **poets used intense imagery, symbols, and disrupted syntax to suggest feelings/experiences** rather than directly referring to them.
- **Definition: Expressionism**
    - Expressionism is a movement that can be applied to early 20th century art and music.
    - In art, the artist attempts to depict an emotional experience rather than a physical entity.
        - These depictions are subjective and are meant to evoke a mood or idea.
    - In music, expressionism is characterized by its **avoidance to traditional forms of beauty in favor of angular melodies and dissonance** that were meant to **express personal feelings**.
<br/>

---
**The Rise of Psychoanalysis**
- Psychologists began to question what it meant to be human.
- Freud's psychoanalytical theories introduced the notion that human behavior is the product of unconscious impulses which are repressed by societal expectations.
- This view of human nature was significant in initiating a shift from the Romantic view of the individual as protagonist in their own narrative.
- **Humans were now portrayed as being subject to both internal and external forces, some of which they were not even consciously aware.**
<br/>

**Post-Tonal Music**
- The modernist demand for a radical, and original departure from traditional tonality prompted a break from tonality.
  - Composers developed their own approaches to post-tonal composition, resulting in **diverse compositional styles in the 20th century**.
  - While composers like Debussy organized their works around a tonal centre, other composers opted for composing completely atonal work.
- One of the most notable approaches to pitch organization from the early 20th century was developed by Arnold **Schoenberg**.
  - Around 1908, Schoenberg embraced **atonality**, a term we use to describe music that **completely avoids tonal centres**. This style of composition is extremely dissonant and devoid of any need for resolution.
  - From his initial experiments with atonality, Schoenberg developed his most innovative compositional system: the **12-tone** method.
<br/>

**Arnold Schoenberg and 12-Tone Technique**
- Schoenberg experimented with ways to bring **formal coherence** to atonal music in a way that would match tonal music.
  - In the 1920s he developed the 12-tone method.
  - The 12-tone method uses the **12 tones of the chromatic scale** which are **arranged in a specific order** by the composer. This initial arrangement of notes is called the prime row.
  - C-C#-D-D#-E-F-F#-G-G#-A-A#-B: The composer arranges these in an order of their choosing to create the **prime row**.
- This is also called **serialism** or **dodecaphonic** music.
<br/>

- The composer typically **states the prime row first with subsequent statements being variations of the prime row**.
- These variations can be **retrograde** (the prime row backwards), **inversion** (the prime row but with reversed upward or downward motion), or **retrograde-inversion** (a combination of the two).
- The 12-tone method organizes the pitches in a coherent way, but still **avoids privileging any one pitch** in the way tonal music does.
- Schoenberg combined this method of composition with traditional instrumental forms (e.g. variations, string quartet, piano suites).
<br/>

---
**The Second Viennese School**
- **Schoenberg**, and his students Alban **Berg** and Anton **Webern**, are often referred to as the **Second Viennese School**.
- This title makes an explicit connection between Schoenberg and his pupils and the **First** Viennese School: **Haydn**, **Mozart**, **Beethoven**.
<br/>

**Anton Webern**
- Began lessons with Schoenberg in 1904.
- Webern adopted 12-tone method of composition. He believed that it was the **inevitable result of music's evolution**, a **natural discovery** rather than an innovation.
- Webern's compositions are deeply **expressive**, but also very concentrated, often using very **minimal** means.
  - He believed that art should only do what is necessary. He would sometimes deem a work finished once he had incorporated all 12 tones. Some of his shortest atonal pieces have only 20 notes.
- He also made use of understated dynamics that were very precisely indicated.
- Webern received very little claim during his life; however, he became more widely recognized by composers and scholars after WWII.
<br/>

Webern's *Symphony, op.21 (1928): Movement 2, Variationen*
- This symphony was written using **12-tone** technique.
  - This movement is in variation form.
  - Webern creates 7 variations and a coda from his prime row.
- The movement is a **palindrome**: the second half is the first half in reverse. The entire movement pivots around a central note in variation 4. It is symmetric.
- There are smaller palindromes within each variation as well.

<h3>Music and Modernism in Soviet Russia</h3>

**The Russian Revolution**
- **1917**: **Russian revolution** - the first stage of the revolution was spurred on by protests against the Tsarist government and the bread shortage.
  - Russian was poverty-stricken and still played host to serfdom.
  - **Bolsheviks**, lead by Vladimir Lenin, came to power and the tsarist autocracy ended.
- **1922**: **Soviet Union** was founded.
  - The Bolsheviks established the worlds first Communist state.
- **1929**: **Stalin** came to power after Lenin's death. His reign bought industrial and military prosperity to the Soviet Union, but his was a totalitarian rule.
- Potential threads/enemies to Stalin were executed or sent to labour camps. He was responsible for 20 million deaths during his rule.
<br/>

##### Music in Soviet Russia: Socialist Realism and the Composer
- In the Soviet Union, all aspects of life were moderated by the government. This included the arts.
  - The arts were used as a tool to indoctrinate the public into the Marxist-Leninist ideology, celebrate the leadership, and encourage patriotism.
- In the **1934**, the doctrine of **Socialist Realism** was positioned as the ideal aesthetic for arts in the Soviet Union.
- **Socialist Realism (definition)**
  - Socialist realism in the arts, involved using **a realistic style to portray socialism** in a positive light. This involved celebrating the **Russian revolution and its heroes** and demonstrating the progress of the people under the Soviet state.
- Socialist realism in music: **simple/accessible harmonic language**, emphasis on **melody**, **folk-like** style that promotes patriotism.
  - It **stood in opposition to expressionism, modernism, symbolism**, and any kind of abstraction.
  - Creating music that contradicted the tenets of socialist realism could result in death or banishment.
<br/>

**Sergey Prokofiev (1891 - 1953)**
- Was **initially known as a radical modernist**.
  - After the Russian Revolution, he toured North America and Western Europe for 20 years.
  - During this time he fulfilled various commissions, composing and performing his own piano works as well as producing larger works such as his opera, *The Love for Three Oranges* (1921).
- He was motivated to return to the Soviet Union by the government's offer of commission and performances.
  - He returned to Russia in 1936.
  - He fulfilled several government commissions, including a ballet, a film score, and music for children, all of which were successful and entered the standard repertory of Russian music.
<br/>

**Dmitri Shostakovich (1906 - 1975)**
- Was educated and worked within the Soviet system his entire life.
- His early works demonstrate closer ties with modernism than with Socialist Realism.
- Shostakovich's oeuvre includes 15 symphonies, 6 concerti, numerous chamber works and works for solo piano, opera, and music for film.
- This symphony clearly conformed to the expectations of socialist realism: clear harmonic language, optimistic populist outlook - this was seen as Shostakovich's rehabilitation in the eyes of the state.
<br/>

<h3>Russian Ballet in the 20th Century</h3>

**Igor Stravinsky (1882 - 1971)**
- Russian-born composer active in the 20th century.
- Known for having multiple stylistic changes during his career.
  - His early compositional period is considered his "Russian Period" (up to 1919).
  - During this period he developed his trademark style, derived from elements of Russian music.
    - Either **folk** or styles developed from his Russian precursors.
  - This style is defined by his use of **unpredictable accents** to undermine meter, rapid changes in meter, ostinatos, layering and juxtaposition of static blocks of sound, discontinuity and interruption, dissonance, anti-lyrical but colorful use of instruments.
- He moved to Paris in 1911, lived in Switzerland during WWI.
  - He could not return to Russia after the Bolshevik Revolution.
  - Worked with the impresario Sergei Diaghilev for the Ballet Russes - it was during this time that he was commissioned to write *The Firebird*, *Petrushka*, and *The Rite of Spring*.
<br>

##### Petrushka (1910-1911)
- A ballet about a love triangle between three puppets who are brought to life by a magician during a carnival.
  - Choreography by Michel Fokine.
  - Ballet features a very strong relationship between music and the visual movement of the dancers, whereas in opera the music accompanies the singers and aids the drama.
  - No singing or speaking in the ballets that we will be studying.
- **Testable listening example: Opening of Pertrushka, First Tableau, "The Shrivetide Fair"**
  - Fair at the end of carnival.
  - **Blocks of static harmony**.
    - **Repetitive melodic and rhythmic patterns.**
    - **Abrupt shifts from one block to another**.
    - Different groups of dancers receive their own music, creating music to accompany distinct visual imagery.
  - These different musical settings allusions to Russian **folk** songs (3:22), Viennese **waltzes** (4:33), and **popular** French songs (4:46).
  - Notice the **variety of instrumental colours** Stravinsky uses and switches suddenly between - lyrical, and warm-sounding flute melodies are suddenly replaced by harsh brass or strings.
  - His orchestration is colorful and **dynamic**, he plays with timbre by **juxtaposition dramatically different tone colours**.

##### The Rite of Spring (1913)
- Stravinsky's most famous ballet from his Russian period.
- Choreography by Vaslav Nijinsky.
- The ballet takes place in an imagined prehistoric Russia, an adolescent girl must dace herself to death after being chosen for sacrifice as part of a fertility ritual.
- Still feature borrowed **folk** melodies, but the scenario, choreography, and music are considered examples of **primitivism**: purposed representations of **crudeness**, a deliberate **rejection of the sophistication** associated with modern life and trained artistry (dancer's toes turned inward).
- The first performance was met with the famous Rite of Spring riot.
<br/>

**Testable Example: "Dance of the Adolescent Girls" from *The Rite of Spring***
- Metric **regularity is subverted by unpredictable accented chords**.
- Jarring for the listener, but the dancers can actually count four-measure phrases.
- **Stravinsky used instrumental timbre to mark musical ideas in the orchestral texture**: the pounding block chords are always played by **strings** and **horns**, the ostinato is played primarily by the **English horn**.
- This opening is build on the juxtaposition between **blocks of chords and ostinatos**.
  - **Ostinatos (definition)**: **short musical pattern** that is repeated persistently throughout a piece or section.
- **No motivic development**, interest is created by changes in texture, timbre.
- Stravinsky preferred harsher and drier **timbres**, staccato **strings**, staccato **horns** and **bassoon**, pizzicato in **cellos**.
- **Dissonance** in his music is created by mixing collections of **diatonic and octatonic scales**.
  - **Octatonic scales (definition)**: a scale that alternates **whole and half steps**.
<br/>

##### Stravinsky the Neoclassicist
- **Neoclassicism (definition)**: trend in music from the 1910s to the 1950s in which composers revived, imitated, or evoked the styles, genres, and forms of **pre-romantic music**, especially those from the **18th** century.
- Defined by movement away from Russian folk music towards earlier Western art music styles.
  - **Rejection of romanticism after WWI because of its associations with nationalism.**
- After Schoenberg's death, Stravinsky experimented with Serialism.
<br/>

## Week 6: Musicals I, Gender and Sexuality in London's West End

#### From Opera to Musical
- **Musical (definition)**: a genre of **musical theatre** that features songs and dance numbers **in styles drawn from popular music in the context of a spoken play with dramatic underpinnings**.
- Mixed origins: operetta, comic opera, vaudeville, minstrel shows, jazz
- Initially called musical comedies in the 1880s, in the 20th century they were also called musical romances and musical plays; the standalone term musical was more commonly used after mid-century.
  - Developed primarily in Britain and the US.
  - Change in subject matter from **light comedy and romance to social commentary** from the early 20th to late 20th century.

**What is different about a musical?**
- **There is usually spoken dialogue.**
- Orchestra might be **traditional** or **contemporary** (i.e. include the use of instrument associated with popular styles like drum kit and electric guitar).
- **Utilization of popular music styles**: jazz, ragtime, country, rock, hip hop.
- Types of singing: singing in a musical requires different training than opera. Female singers in musicals often employ what is called the **belt voice**.
  - **mid-range, bright, and loud** type of singing typically associated with female voices - generated from the chest

---
**A Tale of Two Musical Cities: New York and London**
- London's West End has played host to the development of British musical theatre since the late 19th century.
- This area is also associated with theatre more broadly - these links go back to the 17th century.
- Currently, there are 39 theatres in London's West End.
<br/>

---
<h3>Gender and Sexuality</h3>

**Applications to Musical Theatre**
- Gender in music studies: **representation** of maleness and femaleness.
- **Queer theory**: interpreting music from a gay or lesbian perspective, intersections with masculinity, questions traditional gender positions.
<br/>

**Wolf asserts that**
- The representation and performance of **gender and sexuality in musicals function as building blocks as basic to the form as song, dance, script, or design**. Whether or not a musical seems to be about gender or about sexuality, these axes of identity inevitably organize a musical's message, its **ideological** work, and its **emotional effects**, since all of the characters in a musical can be identified and analyzed in terms of their gender and sexuality.
<br/>

<h4>The Phantom and the Feminine<br/>Christine's Soprano as Female</h4>

**The Phantom of the Opera**
- Written by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Time Rice.
  - Premiered in 1986 at Her Majesty's Royal Theatre in London's West End.
- Opulent costumes and scenery, stunning special effects.
- **Musically, it combines mock classical styles with contemporary songwriting sensibilities.**
  - 27-piece orchestra that also includes synthesizers and electric guitar.
- Story of a physically deformed musical genius living underneath a 19th century Paris opera house and his entanglement with an up-and-coming soprano and her suitor.
- Based on the novel by Leroux.
<br/>

**Christine Daae: Female, Soprano, Ingenue**
- Stacy Wolf identifies **Christine as fulfilling the archetype of the Ingenue**: young innocent female, unsophisticated but endearing.
- Christine's **femaleness** is **represented by her high soprano voice**, little use of chest or belt voice, her songs are lyrical and **often feature very delicate accompaniment** (flute, light string).
- Her musical characterization suggests that she is **innocent, delicate, lacking power**.
- Her role as a female is defined with respect to three prominent men in her life: the memory of her **father**, her mentor the **Phantom**, and her suitor **Raul**.
<br/>

##### Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again
- This song marks a major point in Christine's character development.
- **Notice her vocal range and delivery: very high (head voice) and delicate, her feminity and naivete is coded in this delivery.**
- Lloyd Webber uses very sparse accompaniment for the majority of this song, opting to use instruments whose timbre and range complements Christine's: **violin, flute, harp**.
- Notice the very **sparing use of horns** and **absence of percussion**.
- **Once Christine resolves to let go of the memory of her father, her musical characterization changes**: she uses the lower end of her register (association with older female characters), dramatic drum and cymbal crashes, more brass, fuller orchestra.
<br/>

<h4>Representations of Maleness and Male Character Development<br/>Marius's Movement From Homosocial to Heterosexual in Les Miserables</h4>

**Les Miserables**
- Composed by Claude-Michel Schonberg.
  - Words by Alain Boubil.
  - Premiered in London's West End in 1985, it's still running.
- Spectacular stage design: unfolding barricade.
- **Musically combines classical styles with contemporary song writing sensibilities.**
  - **Sparing use of dissonance, tuneful melodies, easy to remember songs, lush orchestration.**
- Tells the story of an ex-con running from a relentless police officer because he broke parole. The story unfolds over several decades and is told against the backdrop of **civil unrest** and the **Paris Uprising in 1832**.
<br/>

**Marius Pontmercy: a Study in Male Character Development**
- Wolf identifies **a common narrative direction that involves a male character's movement between two social circles: one composed of his male friends, the other revolving around a female love interest**/wife.
- "Through the force of the narrative, told insistently in song and dance and script, many musicals convey the **ideological message that proper maturity is becoming feminized/masculinized**. Moreover, proper feminization/masculinization is inseparable from **heterosexual awakening**. In this way, musicals tie together psychological development, gender, and (hetero)sexuality."
- For Marius, this process is most clearly represented in the song, "The ABC cafe/Red Black".
<br/>

##### The ABC Cafe/Red Black
- This song represents the beginning of Marius's departure from his group of friends.
- Despite his friends' teasing, his interest in Cosette represents his **transition to adulthood** and a type of **masculinity** that is different from the boyish bravado of his peers.
- This proper masculinization is inextricably linked to his budding heterosexual relationship with Cosette.
- **Marius is a tenor** in this production (sometimes a lyric baritone): though this voice type represents the upper range of male voice, it is **often used to represent young male characters, especially romantic leads**.
- **Prominent use of horns and percussion** not only underlines the martial themes enmeshed in this plot line of the musical, but also **musically establishes the cafe as a masculine space**. Use of male chorus.
- Notice how the orchestral texture changes when the characters are mockingly talking about Marius's love-struck condition; **Love-struck theme: light strings and winds** (feminine).
- By the end of the song these two become **conflated**, **representing Marius's maturation** and induction to the **world of adult masculinity and heterosexuality**.
<br/>

---
<h4>Representations of Homosexuality in Musicals</h4>

**Vague Identities of Gay Characters**
- Heterosexual relationship tend to figure most prominently in musicals written before the 21st century.
- The earliest inclusions of gay characters, such as those in *A Chorus Line* (1975), were not fully developed. For example, multiple characters would be presented as gay, but only one of those characters would receive significant development and a clear gay identity.
<br/>

---
<h4>Billy Elliot: Playing With Gender and Sexuality Expectations</h4>

- Based on the film of the same name, *Billy Elliot* the musical premiered in London's West End in 2005.
  - Music by Elton John and words by Lee Hall.
- It tells a story of a motherless boy who comes from a working-class family in Country Durham (north east England). **Billy's secret love for dance is at odds with his father's masculine sensibilities as a coal miner on strike.**
  - Billy's story is told against the backdrop of a **labour dispute** and issues of **class inequality**.
- Music is **popular** in style, reminiscent of John's other work; however there is a **full orchestra** with the addition of **synthesizers**, **electric guitar**/bass, **drum kit**. **John juxtaposes different popular styles, perhaps to mirror the musical's contrasting themes revolving around masculinity and feminity.**
- Billy loves to dance and is labeled as gay by his brother and neighborhood friend; however he is not. His best friend, Michael, is gay. Michael reveals that he has feelings for Billy.
<br/>

##### Solidarity
- **Juxtaposes the feminine refinement of the ballet school** (a feminine space) **with the masculine space of the strike-related conflicts** between the miners and scabs.
- The juxtaposition is represented musically as well as in the choreography.
- Notice how the ballet sections of **light strings and keyboard are juxtaposed with the chorus of men chanting solidarity** against a **backdrop of a heavy rock groove** with distorted electric guitar tones and harsh brass.
- The chorus features a fuller orchestra and harsher timbre (blaring horns).
- In some cases the chorus is meant to be ironic: the scabs celebrating their newfound monetary gain at the expense of the striking coal miners.
- **Two themes: children's/ballet theme (arpeggios and counting), solidarity/rock theme (chanting with horns and sax).**
- The **ballet** and **solidarity themes** eventually become **conflated**. Representation of Billy's own position as a young heterosexual boy who loves to dance within the domain of a world that is strongly coded as masculine.
- This example features a lot of spoken dialogue.
<br/>

**Billy and Michael**
- By the end of the musical, Michael reveals he has feelings for Billy, but Billy does not feel the same way.
- Michael's love is unrequited, and his story is not as developed as that as Billy's; however, the platonic relationship between the two young boys who feel like outsiders in their own community bolsters their self-confidence. They support each other.
  - Billy represents the kind of courage Michael would like to have.
  - Though Billy cannot return Michael's feelings, he does not let Michael's revelation jeopardize their friendship.
- Billy is meant to represent **a new, less-toxic kind of masculinity**. **His relationship with Michael represents the truest embodiment of the theme of solidarity.**
- Overall, the musical espouses **the value of individuality**.
<br/>

## Week 7. Musicals II. Performing Identity on Broadway

**Broadway**
- Theatre district in New York.
- "Born from a melange of performance forms that included **opera and operatta, vaudeville and burlesque, minstrelsy and jazz**, musicals have always **sought to amuse more than instruct**, and to make money more than make political change... Reflecting, refracting, and shaping US culture since the early twentieth century, musicals converse with shifting dynamics of **gender and sexuality, ethnicity and race, and the very question of what it means to be American and to be human**. The musical explores identity, self-determination, and the American dream."
- Emphasis on the Americanness of the musical in scholarship; **embodiment of American ideals and the American dream**.
- Variety of musical styles and dances employed by composers since the 19th century: **jazz, blues, ragtime, waltz, polka**.
<br/>

#### Broadway Songs and Orchestration

**Song Types**
- **Opening number**
- **Soliloquy**: character reveals inner feelings
- **Ballad**: slow song with associations with love or another emotion.
- **Charm song**: song that represents an optimistic outlook, typically rhythmic with a light character, not necessarily humorous.
- **"I want" Song (definition): reveals a main character's motivation early in the plot** (common in Broadway musicals)
- **"Eleven-o-Clock number" (definition): meant to increase energy in 2nd act** (common in Broadway musicals)
- **Act Finale**: memorable ending to an act, powerfully sums up character motivations and plot developments.
<br/>

**Orchestration**
- Orchestration is more of a secondary consideration in the production of a musical.
- This process involves filling out harmonies in songs, **adding timbres and rhythmic emphasis**. 
  - Three stages of orchestration: 1) arranging 2) orchestration 3) extraction
- **Arranging (definition)**: **applying a dance pattern to a song**, creating intros, interludes, codas, deciding on keys and types of accompaniment.
- **Orchestration (definition)**: translating everything from step one into notes on a page.
- **Extraction (definition)**: creating **individual parts for each instrument** using the full score created in step 2 (score vs. parts).
- Orchestration in Broadway is defined by the **amalgamation of European music and dominant American music styles**, but it depends on time period.
<br/>

<h4>Critical Framework: Identity</h4>

**Studying Representations of Identity in Music**
- Related to subjectivity, **identity is a response to something outside the individual**, something that represents alterity or otherness.
- Identity can be related to class, culture, race, nationality, gender, sexuality, religion, age, disability.
- **With respect to music, identities of performers, characters, and listeners are studied.**
- **Subject position (definition)**: a concept borrowed from studies in film, **subject position refers to the viewpoints represented by a film**. "By **constructing music that is closely linked with a particular character** in a film, a perceiver is most likely to engage with the subject position of that character."
- The concept of subject position can be applied to musicals because of the visual/staged elements of the genre.
<br/>

---
<h4>Wicked</h4>

**Wicked Overview**
- Premiered on Broadway in 2003.
- Music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz.
- Tells the story of Elphaba, "The Wicked Witch of the West", as a young woman before the events of the Wizard of Oz.
<br/>

**Elphaba: A Malleable Metaphor for Otherness**
- Social outcast because of her **green skin**.
  - She longs for acceptance.
  - Becomes a passionate teen with strong beliefs.
- **Her singing parts are much different from ways witches are depicted in other media.** 
  - **Evil characters often receive no singing parts in opera.** Even Disney movies have evil characters deliver their songs in more of a speaking style.
- Her voice (belying alto) suggests **power**, but she is not the idealized soprano like Glinda.
- Relatable portrait of a teenage girl; the source of her otherness (green skin) can be interpreted as any type of otherness (race, gender, social standing, etc.).
<br/>

##### Defying Gravity
- "Song identifies Elphaba as a protagonist, an empowered girl who overcomes the disadvantages of her green skin. **Singing humanizes her and endows her with a voice to rage back against her oppressive world.**"
- Act 1 finale.
- Duet for Glinda and Elphaba, though Elphaba does most of the singing.
- Elphaba is supposed to be an alto but this song utilizes the upper limits of a soprano's range - Menzel does very well, but you can tell the upper range of her voice is not as effortless as Chenoweth's soprano. **This gives Elphaba a very human quality, striving.**
- Orchestration prioritizes **brass** and **percussion** (drum kit primarily): **heroism**.
- Notice how the instruments are balanced. **Drum kit** is very prominent.
- Listener can identify with Elphaba's plight: ostracized and misunderstood, but commits to following her own path - **this subject position is presented by the text, but reinforced by the music ("heroic" orchestration) and her striving voice**.

<h4>Hamilton: an American Musical Overview</h4>

- Music and lyrics by Lin-Manuel Miranda. Orchestrated by Alex Lacamoire.
- Premiered on Broadway in 2015.
- Stylistically diverse, but orchestral.
  - Used a **diverse cast to tell the story of the American Revolution**. People of color represent white historical figures.
<br/>

**Creation and Performance of Identity in Hamilton**
- Hamilton is interesting in that **the musical style and casting represent the creation of identity to tell a historical tale.**
  - Described as **a story of America's past being told by America's present**.
  - Some criticism that the production uses black actors to portray white slave owners; these critics believe that the show erases true black history while celebrating the deeds of white men.
<br/>

##### My Shot
- Example of an **"I Want" song** - becomes Hamilton's mantra throughout the show.
- **Hip-hop with gospel.**
- **Diverse instrument groupings: strings and percussion, horns and percussion, piano with bass.**
  - Makes use of timbre and dynamic juxtaposition: **bombastic horns vs. pizzicato strings**, **forte chorus vs. piano of Alexander's asides** (snapping).
- Cleverly plays with the word shot - chance, guns, drinks, musical shots align with the text.
- Each character performs a **racial otherness** against the backdrop of a hip-hop beat and allusions to gospel, listen to the timbre of their voices, delivery of text.
- This musical otherness is complemented by the visual imagery of the production.
- There is an element of using these performed identities to claim history, and re-write it. Encourages a reconsideration of the role of non-white Americans in the revolution. Fighting for a place in history.
  - Plays into the theme of storytelling or **"Who tells your story"**.
<br/>

## Week 8. Orchestral Film Scores

<h4>The Golden Age of Film and the Rise of the Orchestral Soundtrack</h4>

- Films from the **golden era** often have **lush orchestral** scores, often composed and recorded after shooting the images.
- Some composers who wrote in more contemporary idioms (Max Steiner, Erich Korngold) demonstrate the influence of the Second Viennese School.

#### Diegetic vs Non-Diegetic Music
- **Diegetic music (definition)**: Music that can be heard by the characters in the film of the diegesis or world of the film. This can take the form of music being played on a radio or sung by a character.
- **Non-Diegetic Music (definition)**: Background music, not heard by the characters in the film; often composed as part of a soundtrack for the film.
<br/>

---
**Rashoman (1950)**
- Orchestral music by Fumio Hayasaka; score is reminiscent of Ravel's **Bolero**.
- Score contributes to the drama of each witness's testimony, except for the last testimony by an impartial witness, which is not accompanied.
- **Wife**'s account is most reminiscent of Ravel's Bolero: **dance-like quality, 3/4 time, similar orchestration to the Bolero**.
- The **samurai**'s account is made otherworldly by prominent use of **reed instruments, percussion, and brass**. Not as richly orchestrated as the wife's account. Strings are reserved for dramatic effect.
<br/>

---
**Original Soundtrack to Ip Man (2008)**
- Original score by Kenji Kawai.
- Traditional Chinese instruments in the Ip Man OST:
  - **Erhu**: a bowed lute with **two strings**; constructed with a wooden neck that meets a hexagonal body covered with snakeskin. The two strings are often tuned to A and D.

## Week 9. Orchestral Music for Television

**Early Television**
- Shift from radio entertainment to tv in the 1940s and 50s.
- Post-war entertainment and media were shifting.
  - Most growth in commercial tv took place in the 1950s.
- Initially there was some mistrust of visual broadcasting in the entertainment industry, but eventually tv supplanted radio entertainment.
<br/>

#### Television Studies
- **Sign**: in semiotics, something which **communicates meaning**, such as a word, an image or a sound.
- **Flow**: the ways that programmes, advertisements, etc. follow one another in an unbroken sequence across the day or part of the day, and the experience of watching the sequence of programmes, advertisements, trailers, etc.
- **Niche audience**: groups of viewer defined by age group, gender, or economic status, for example, who may be the target audience for a programme.
- **Title sequence**: sequence at the opening of a tv program in which the **program title and performers' names** may appear along with other info, accompanied by images, sound, and music introducing the program.
- **Intertexuality**: how one text draws on the meanings of another by referring to it by allusion, quotation or parody.
- **Pan**: a shot where the camera is turned to the left or right, creating a wide visual field.
- **Close-up**: a camera shot where the frame is filled by the face of a person or a detail of a face. Close-ups may also show details of an object or place.
<br/>

---
**What can we learn from title sequences?**
- "The **title sequences** of programmes are **sequences of signs** that signify the boundaries between one part of the **flow** of tv and those parts of the flow that precede and follow them. In this respect. title sequences offer cues to viewers that enable them to identify the genre of a programme. There are many different kinds of **sign** that a title sequence might contain, that will enable a viewer to identify the pleasures offered by a programme, and many of these pleasures are connected to genre. For example, the title sequences of news programme often contain:
  - dramatic orchestral music
  - images signifying the global coverage of news event
  - the immediacy of news signified by a time of day or a clock
  - signifiers of the institutions such as Parliament that are the producers of newsworthy events
<br/>

---
##### The Crown's Title Sequence
- composed by Hans Zimmer
- **Ambient quality - no main musical theme** (no hummable melody).
  - Stately and austere quality - starts with **woodwinds**, **layers strings**.
  - **Sparing use of percussion**, **horns** are present, but **not prominent**.
  - **Synthesizer pulses** underneath, very faint, reminiscent of The Dark Knight.
- Abstract, ambient-style music accompanied by close-up shots.
  - As the music unfolds, the shots zoom out.
- This stately and dignified marriage between music and image underlies genre of the show - historical drama/fiction.
- Themes in the early seasons: **coming of age, duty, maturation**.
<br/>

---
##### Game of Thrones Title Sequence
- Composed by Ramin Djawadi.
- Miniature **cello concerto**.
- Driving **timpani rhythm** - epic fantasy, martial quality.
- **Lyrical** theme, very singable.

- The music helps to signify **genre**.
<br/>

**Images on screen**
- The title theme displays a moving map of Westeros - rising kingdoms.
- **Its transitory nature underscores the impermanence of power in the show** - constantly changing.
- It also serves to **update the audience on who holds power and where** - banners for Winterfell change throughout the seasons (direwolf - fiery ruins - flayed man).
- It provides the audience with an **overview of the show's many locales** - also changes with the seasons.
- This aids the viewer in following the story - countless characters and locales.
- Series of various shots: **close-up, pan**.
<br/>

---
##### The Mandalorian Theme
- Composed by Ludwig Goransson.
- Functions differently from our first two examples: **just a snippet is played at the beginning of the show** - it is played in full at the end (accompanied by artistic renderings of what happened in the episode), and **quoted for dramatic effect throughout the show** (fanfare presented when Mando is heroic).
- Opens with **pulsing floor tom** in the percussion and **overblown recorder**.
- Very **unique tone** and **colour palette**: Goransson combines a 70-piece orchestra with **recorders**, **guitars**, **drum kit**, and several types of **synthesizers**.
- The result is a memorable theme that harkens back to John Williams's OSTs for Star Wars and 60s sci-fi tv programs - **intertextuality**.
- Theme is memorable and hummable, but not lyrical and singable like GOT.
<br/>

**What does the theme signify?**
- Brief quotations played at the beginning when the title screen is shown - just the pulsing floor tom with overblown recorder: **drama** and **intrigue**, overblown recorder reminiscent of sound effects in **traditional western**.
- Mando as lone gunslinger figure; **anti-hero** or reluctant hero.
- When shown during end credits: disparate instrumentation signifies the **otherworldly** (sci-fi), Mando is also an **outsider** (ethnic minority, bounty hunter, not part of regular society).
- **Music and image**: hand-drawn, painterly aesthetic aesthetic of the end credits serves to sum up major narrative developments, but also softens Mando's characterizations.
- In his interview, Goransson mentions some important points: **orchestra adding human element** and **synthesizer ostinato** lending the theme a **child-like quality**.
<br/>

  - Second theme has more of a **symphonic** quality:
    - stronger sense of melody created by **horns** and **violin** (less atmospheric, more melody-driven)
    - music becomes more prominent and organized: Ludwig's movement from beast to man
- Elements of horror unscored by musical tropes associated with horror films: **tremolo** strings for suspense, choral chanting.

---
**Philip Glass**
- Learned flute and violin as a child.
- Glass's compositional output includes film scores, symphonic music, operas, and music for smaller ensembles.

##### Glass's Compositional Style
- In the 1960s, Glass was associated with minimalist composers such as Steve Reich, Terry Riley and Lamonte Young.
- **Minimalism (definition)**: one of the leading styles of composition in the late 20th century. **Amount of musical materials used are reduced to a minimum and procedures are simplified.**
  - Often characterized by a constant pulse and many **repetitions of simple rhythmic, harmonic, and melodic patterns**, e.g. Steve Reich's Clapping Music (1972) and Electric Counterpoint (1987).
- Glass's minimalist style began to emerge after he became familiar with the additive processes and cyclic structures of **East Indian music** (he made transcriptions of Ravi Shankar's music) and when he and Steve Reich began to study each other's music.
<br/>

**The Philip Glass Ensemble**
- For much of his career, Glass has composed exclusively for his own ensemble.
- He wrote for the ensemble in the 1960s and early 70s mark the beginning of his mature style.
- **This minimalist styles was harmonically static and cyclic**, **involving the addition and subtraction of different musical and rhythmic patterns**. The instruments used by the ensemble were **amplified**, making for a style that was more evocative of rock than classical music.
- In addition to working with his ensemble, Glass has also collaborated with various rock and pop musicians: Paul Simon, David Byrne, Suzannne Vega.
<Br/>

**David Bowie's Heroes (1977)**
- In the 1990s, Glass composed two symphonies **Low** and **Heroes**, which were inspired by David Bowie's albums of the same names. When Low was first released, Bowie and co-writer Brian Eno cited Glass as a primary influence on the album.
- **Heroes** is Bowie's 12th studio album.
  - Second album in the **Berlin Trilogy**: Low, Heroes, and Lodger.
  - Bowie worked on these albums after re-locating to **West Berlin** in 1977.
  - They take inspirations from the city's then-divided status.
  - Hansa Studios, where the album was recorded, was in close proximity to the wall.
- The album is considered **art rock**, an experimental work that features several instrumental tracks in addition to tracks with vocals.
- The music on the album is all about **sound and the sonic experience**. Bowie and Eno use syhthesizers to manipulate the sounds we hear.
<Br/>

**Track 3: Heroes**
- The song is supposedly about a couple that Bowie would see meeting under a gun turret at the Berlin Wall.
- He believed that they were having an affair and that by meeting at the Wall, a decidedly repressive meeting spot, they were enacting some type of heroism.
<br/>

##### Heroes Symphony (1993)
- From the material on Bowie's album, Glass created a 6-movement symphony based on 6 of the 10 tracks on the album.
- Glass does not directly quote his source material, he draws more broadly from the album.
- **He takes particular features of the song, and repeats them within a very simple musical texture.**
  - He does not really develop the material.
- This symphony was originally conceived as a score for a ballet for Twyla Tharp, a New York-based choreographer who was looking for music for her new dance company.
<br>

**Heroes, Movement I**
- Based on the title track of Bowie's album.
- Glass takes elements of the original song and **scatters them throughout the movement**
  - **There are no direct, recognizable reference to Bowie's song.**
- This movement exemplifies Glass's style:
  - it features the **repitition of small melodic fragments**, **repeated patterns**, **addictive and subtractive processes**.
- The form is free: **Glass repeats one theme for most of the movement.**
  - He briefly presents another theme halway through the movement.
- **Openingmotive in the horns** is reminiscent of the main notes in the guitar **riff** in the chorus of the origianl song.
- **Constant swirling arpeggio patterns in the violins go back and forth** between two starting notes perhaps derived from the two chords of the song's verse.
- **Repeated rhythmic pattern** in the main theme derived from the original song's chorus.
<br/>

- "if the system isn't working anymore, then do what Guy Fawkes tried and go anarchist: Blow it all up, and start again."
- written in 2011
- single movement
- prominent use of syncopation
  - **syncopation (definition)**: **deliberate upsetting of the meter** or pulse through temporary shifting of the accent to a weaker bear or off beat.
- **Hard timbres of brass are priviledged** - explosive quality, jazz references
- inclusion of **drum kit** and **piano**
