## Aristotle

#### The Purpose of Government

Since Aristotle believes in the **teleological account** which states that all things including any associations come into being for the sake of some good and human always act in order to obtain that which they think is good. So, for him, any communities comes into existence for the sake of mere life, and a political one, which is the highest of all, and which embraces all the rest, aims at good in a greater degree than any other, and at the highest good - **self-sufficiency and good life**.

What is self-sufficiency? For Aristotle, a society which is established for the prevention of mutual crime, for the sake of exchange and mere life is not enough to be a polis or a political community, as these conditions are only necessary but not sufficient. By contrast, a polis is characterized by a **community** of families and aggregations of families in **well-being** which includes but not limited to actively participating in public affairs, being a good neighbor and member of a local community, giving generously to important charities, etc. That is, enables every member of the community to achieve a perfect life that is closely related to the ultimate good of an individual - **Eudaimonia**, or happiness.

This leads to Aristotle's definition of a **good, worthy life**, which is only attainable in a political community. For him, **happiness** is the complete final cause for a good life for all human beings and to which all other goods are subordinate. Similarly, let's first see what are not sufficient for a good life. It's definitely not mere life, since the life of nutrition and growth is the characteristic activity of plants and inanimate substance; it's not a life guided by perception, whether it's sense perceptions like pleasures of taste, listening, watching, etc. or invisible perceptions like vanity, as it is characteristic of animals except for human. The good life does not consist only wealth, power, honour, knowledge as well; according to Aristotle, the characteristic activity of human life is to **lead an active life in accordance with reason**, that is, acting actively and virtuously, being guided not by appetite alone, but also by reason.

And a political community is indispensable for an individual to achieve this end. Since in order for people to become virtuous, argument and teaching are not powerful by themselves; those who live by passion do not hear or understand them. According to Aristotle, the soul or character must first be **cultivated by means of habits** for taking pleasure in what is good and finding painful what is bad. Education and law in a polis precisely help to establish this kind of cultivation to **stimulate men to virtue** and urge them forward by the deeds of the noble. Additionally, punishments and penalties will be imposed on those who disobey and of inferior nature.
<br/>

>The end
> Compared to Aristotle's view, Locke's account of the political community's purpose is relatively more negative or passive, he believes the aim to be the preservation of property while Aristotle think it's the good life that a proper political community is aiming for. 

> The formation
> For Aristotle, the political community is formed spontaneously from the human nature to act according to what is good. While for Locke, the state of nature will not transform to a proper political community naturally without mutually consenting to a common social contract.

#### State of Nature

What does it mean to be a political animal? According to Aristotle, the definition of a political animal is just a being that desires to **live together socially** with its fellow beings. And living a social life is no less than having exchange and mutual intercourse within some kind of associations or communities. So, bees and other gregarious animals can also be considered as political animals, except for Aristotle there is a degree to which a subject can be social or political. Language, or the ability of speech, serves as this demarcation between human beings and other animals. For human by nature possess consciously a perception of **moral judgement** while other company-loving animals can only express pleasure and pain by making sound or using whatever method.

However, for Aristotle, this political quality isn’t just another peculiarity of human beings, it’s the **necessary condition for fulfilling the end of humanity**. In Nicomachean Ethics, he proposed a teleological framework in which the end or the chief good of humanity is considered to be “activity of soul in accordance with virtue”.  This function account suggests that the end of human is to achieve happiness by living a virtuous and active life following rational principles.  And in order to achieve this ultimate good, it’s necessary to have a community like city for an individual is not self-sufficing when being isolated and a non-sufficient life fails to meet the precondition of a good life; **Therefore, if people aim for the virtuous life by nature, it follows that they must be born as political animals.**
<br/>

> Government
> Their different attitudes toward law consequently lead to their different ideals of government. Without any terror of some common power, Hobbes suggests, the so-called laws of nature are flimsy since everyone is subordinate to their own reasons. In order to enforce these laws, an artificial generation of commonwealth is required. 
> On the contrary, for Aristotle, the government is both natural and should take orders from plurality rather than unity.

> Law
> For Hobbes, the ultimate purpose of law is to eliminate the natural state of war and endeavour peace as much as one can. Aristotle’s proposition of law instructs the citizens on what to do since in his view most people by nature already possess the perception of moral judgement and those who don’t are treated as beasts and have already been excluded from the system of governing.

#### Private property

Aristotle defends individual property for the ideal of individual virtue and a conception of the common good tied to a certain picture of human nature, since the good life of an individual is an essential part of the common good and **personal property enables individual virtue and flourishing** because **self-sufficiency** is the foremost thing to be desired, which is a prerequisite for an individual's virtuous life, so it is best for the common good.

According to Aristotle, property should be in a certain sense common, but as a general rule, private; **for when everyone has a distinct interest**, people will not complain of one another, and **they will make more progress, because everyone will be attending to his own business**. And although everyone has her own property, some things she will place at the disposal of her friends, while of others she shares the use with them. So, for Aristotle, it's clearly better that property should be private, but the use of it common; and the special business of the legislator is to **create in people this benevolent disposition**. Additionally, there is the greatest pleasure in doing a **kindness** or **service to friends** or guests or companions, which can only be rendered when a man has private property. This chance of encouraging people to share will be lost by the abolishing of private property.

Moreover, **the abolishment of private property is not that efficient to eliminate the evils existing in states** - suits about contracts, convictions for perjury, flatteries of rich men, which are said to arise out of the possession of private property. These evils are due to the wickedness of human nature, and there will be equal amount of or even more quarrelling among those who have all things in common. And that which is common to the greatest number has the least care bestowed upon it according to Aristotle, for everyone thinks chiefly of his own, hardly at all of the common interest; and everybody is more inclined to neglect the duty which he expects another to fulfill.
<br/>

> Aristotle's defend is more teleological
> However, for Aristotle there can't be unrestrained acquisitiveness which is based on a failure to see that the good of personal wealth is limited and is incompatible with generosity.

---
#### Popular government

Aristotle thinks that popular government can be defended among all the other different forms of government because it's, relatively speaking, the most ideal or the **closest form that exists for the good life**, for virtuous noble actions. And those who contributes the most to a virtuous society should have a greater share in its rule.

For Aristotle, the state should not be ruled by aristocracies, since **it will only coerces other people** by their superior power just as the multitude coerce the rich, and those excluded from rule will resent it and become unstable factors or even enemies of the ruling regime. It doesn't matter whether this group of aristocracies are the good who're well-educated and well-born, for as mentioned, everybody else being excluded form power will be **dishonored** since the positions in a state office are posts of honor; and if one set of people always holds them, the rest must be deprived of them. This also applies to the rule of one person, be it a philosopher king or a tyranny, in this case, the number of those who are dishonored only increases.

So, in order to prevent this kind of resent and instability, the popular government should be preferred, since **the many**, of whom each individual is but an ordinary person, when they meet **together may very likely better than the few good**, if regarded only collectively instead of individually. For each individual among the many has a share of virtue and prudence, and when they meet together, they become in a manner one person, who has many feet, and hands, and sense; that is a figure of their mind and disposition, that is, the multitude when in solidarity is of necessity more virtuous than any individual or class. 

Although, there're inevitable cases in which the popular officers are led into error by their folly or fell into crime for their dishonesty, these can be largely resolved by assigning each of the magistrate some deliberative and judicial functions and not allowing them to hold office singly and for too long. Therefore, through this popular government taken charged by different groups of people for a fixed amount of time before being replaced by another group of elected officers - political equals take turns ruling and being ruled, is usually the more ideal form of polis that aims for the common good and enables and stimulates each member of the state to pursue their good life.

However, according to Aristotle, if one individual or one class is far superior in wisdom and virtue, then they should rule even this kind of situation is rarely seen.

## Hobbes

#### State of Nature

Unlike Aristotle who believes in the natural distinction between masters and slaves, Hobbes reckons that every human being is **born equal, in terms of body and mind**. From this general equality proceeds spontaneously the expectation of attaining the same amount of reward or honour, and precisely this expectation leads to competition in which individuals become mutual enemies. This also results in the diffidence of one another that makes people live in constant fear of being deprived, and the most reasonable way out is to anticipate and eliminate potential competitors ahead of time. Additionally, compared to Aristotle’s a priori moral epistemology , Hobbes believes that there is no such thing as natural perception of justice and injustice when the law is absent. Therefore, the aforementioned competition, diffidence and lack of laws will, according to Hobbes, lead to the **natural state of war in which every individual is against every individual**.

Hobbes has a much more pessimistic view on the purpose of life than Aristotle who believes in the summum bonum. He identifies happiness with a **continual progress of desire that has a momentum of its own**, which is reminiscent of Schopenhauerian Will. Whatever it is that you are searching for or pursuing, Hobbes argues they can never be satisfied as these desires are perpetual and restless. Not only because people are inclined to keep seeking greater power than one has already attained, but also due to their constant fear of others and the insecurity about the future. This forms a vicious cycle in which every individual seems to give up their subjectivity to be dominated by this incessant desire that only ceases in death.

As a result, in this state of nature that's filled with constant fear and uncertainty, there's no place for industry; because the fruit thereof is uncertain; no navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by sea; no instruments of moving, and removing, such things as require much force; And consequently, there will be no culture of the earth, no knowledge of the face of the earth; no account of time; no arts; no letters, no society...

#### Purpose of commonwealth

**The Purpose of commonwealth is peace and security**
For Hobbes, the ultimate purpose of commonwealth is to establish a common power that is strong and powerful enough to preserve one's own life and ultimately to prevent humanity from the natural state of war in which every individual is against every individual. This can only be accomplished by enforcing each member of the state to submit a part of one's right to the commonwealth, that is, restraining the natural right of every individual claiming everything so that one can step away from being impediment to others’ enjoying their own rights originally. 

**The Generation of Common Wealth**
This kind of commonwealth is necessary, since **without any terror of some common power**, Hobbes suggests, the so-called **laws of nature are flimsy** as everyone is subordinate to their own reasons. In order to enforce these laws, an artificial generation of commonwealth is required. This commonwealth is unnatural in the sense that the subjects transfer a portion of their right to a third party which is contrary to their natural passion that drives people to competition, however, this is the only way, according to Hobbes, to erect a common power that can keep all subjects in awe. Once this commonwealth is established, it should be reduced to one individual who acts as the uniting will of the multitude - "one person, of whose acts a great multitude, by mutual covenants one with another, have made themselves every one the author, to the end he may use the strength and means of them all, as he think expedient, for their peace and common defense." This **artificial unity** instantiated by a sovereign is the ultimate power that can never be challenged as once this common power collapses, otherwise all the endeavour to prevent the natural state of war is then gone.
<br/>

#### Sovereignty as Absolutism 

**Sovereignty as Commonwealth**
According to Hobbes, the **absolute rights** conferred to a single monarch, the sovereign, **is the best way to preserve peace and security**. Since for him, interests of monarchs are more consistent with the commonwealth as he considers that the riches, power and honor of a monarch is directly linked to the riches, strength, and reputation of his subjects. As a result, the sovereign cannot be punished whatsoever since he cannot do harm to the commonwealth or his subjects because it would be equal to harm himself, and no one in her/his conscious mind would do that since it would be absurd. Also, the sovereign should be the sole judge of which doctrines threaten the peace and ought not to be taught since he is, simply, the only one with the absolute rights and **he knows what's best for the commonwealth more than anyone else**. Similarly, he should have the right to make all rules including the rules of property, of choosing his own counselors, of rewarding and punishing, of bestowing honors all due to similar reasons – **he is equal to the commonwealth and knows what's the best for himself**.

Also, Monarchs, compared to an assembly, take better counsel, are less inconstant, and cannot disagree with themselves. So, this form of sovereignty is the most **steady** and desirable mean to achieve peace and security. Therefore, from this and the above illustration, it's obvious to see that according to Hobbes, subjects cannot change the form of government not only because he's not wise and capable enough to realise what's the best for commonwealth, but because he simply, doesn't have this the option when the **social contract** is established and doesn't have the right to because the sovereign is not bounded by this contract. 

Similarly, no one could justly protest the selection of the sovereign and accuse the sovereign of injury. Since anyone who is not content with the sovereign's decision and policy is the enemy of the commonwealth, the **dishonest breacher of the social contract**, as they've already gave in their tacit consent when establishing the social contract which bounds individuals to the corresponding sovereign. Not to mention the **separation of powers**, for Hobbes, is one of the greatest **threats** for the sovereign and the peace of a political community as it diminishes the sovereign's absolute rights, and therefore should be rigidly forbidden as they will damage or weaken the commonwealth.

## Locke

#### State of Nature

For Locke, the state of **nature** for human beings is a state of **freedom**, which is the estate all men are naturally in. More specifically, it's a state of perfect freedom that allows people to freely order their actions, and dispose of their possessions and persons as they think fit, within the bounds of the **law of nature** which obliges every one, and teaches all mankind who will but consult it. This law basically states that being all **equal** and **independent**, no one ought to harm another in her life, health, liberty or possessions. And when her own preservation comes not in competition, ought she as much as she can to preserve the rest of humanity.

The state of perfect freedom is also a state of **equality**, wherein all the power and jurisdiction is reciprocal, no one having more than another since they all born to all the same advantages of nature, and use of the same faculties. So, **there cannot be supposed any subordination** among the people that may authorize them to destroy one another. The evidence for this is that all people are the craftsmanship of one omnipotent and infinitely wise Maker; they are the servants of one sovereign Master, sent into the world by His order. Therefore, they are His property, whose workmanship they are made to last during His, not one another's pleasure.

However, as long as people are in this state of total freedom and absolute equality, there will naturally be **powers** in the state of nature in which everyone may interpret for himself what the law of nature mentioned above requires, and this may include the use of force in self-defence. And since **everyone has their own perception and definition of being harmed and self-defence**, those who consider their rights being violated may seek reparation from the wrong-doers; others may aid victims in seeking reparation. As a result, **all may enforce the law** of nature and punish those who break it which inevitably creates some kind of chaos and insecurity. But it's also important to note, according to Locke, **the state of nature does not of necessity lead to the state of war** since there're cases in which people live together properly according to reason and the fundamental law of nature without a common superior on earth with authority to judge between them, and they're perfectly and properly in the state of nature as well. So for him, this state of liberty will **only deteriorate** into a state of war **when** either one person seeks to take the life of another, or one person seeks to put another in his absolute power, for no one's life is secure when subject to another's arbitrary will.

#### Social Contract

Since human beings are by nature **free**, **equal** and **independent** according to Locke, no one can be put out of this estate and subjected to the political power of another without one's own consent, which is done by agreeing with other men, to join and unite into a community for their comfortable, safe, and peaceable living, most importantly, in a **secure enjoyment of their properties**. This, is precisely why a social contract comes into existence.

For Locke, without establishing some sort of social contract, the **state of nature is inadequate** since the moral conception or fundamental law of this state of nature which is the freedom to act without violating another's rights, is not properly enforced. As a result, in a state of nature the powers in it are not limited, everyone may interpret for himself what the law of nature requires and may use force in self-defense; all may enforce the law of nature and punish those who break it; and those whose rights are violated may seek reparation from the wrong-doer, others may aid victims in seeking reparation. Additionally, it's quite possible to incur tendencies to degenerate the state of nature into a state of war in which either one person seeks to take the life of another, or one person seeks to put another in his absolute power for no one's life is secure when subject to another's arbitrary will.

In order to avoid the above defects of the state of nature, people who consent to the social contract should agree to **give up two original powers**. One is of acting howsoever she will consistent with her own interpretation of the law of nature. This enforces a general law that is fixed and universal enough to apply to all the members of a state. The other one being enforcing the law of nature which prevents from the incessant revenge towards each other.

However, the **social contract preserves most of the benefit of the state of nature** as well, in a more peaceful and stable way, including the preservation of life, liberty, and property. Because there're established, settled, known law, received and allowed by common consent to be the standard of right and wrong; there's also known and indifferent judge and reliable power to back and support the sentence when right, and to give it due execution. So the **social contract**, according to Locke, **avoids the inadequacies of the state of nature** while preserving most of the benefits of it.

#### Limited Government

The **social contract needs to be enforced** by some institutions, therefore the legislative and executive powers must be delegate to democratic, oligarchic, monarchical governments - or some mixture of these forms. And the most adequate candidate is a **limited government** in which the legislative power cannot be absolute or arbitrary.

To be more specific, the limits imposed on legislative power should enforce that **the power cannot rule by decree**, but is **bound to dispense justice** and decide the rights of the subject by promulgated standing laws, and known authorized judges. It should also protect people's **right of property**, the supreme power cannot take from anyone of her property without her consent, the consent of a majority where she is represented. Otherwise, it's likely to be dissolved as it acts contrary to the trust reposed when they endeavor to deprive the subject or any part of the community of the lives, liberties, or fortunes. Lastly, the **legislative power cannot be transferred** even though it's delegated it cannot transfer the power to others to avoid external alteration of the legislative power.

The limited government is better than **absolutism** because it diminishes the supreme power of legislation and **preserves** people's **right of resistance**. As Locke puts it, when the people cannot but feel the visible design of abuses, prevarications, and artifices; and see how wither they are going. It's perfectly natural and just for them to rise and endeavor to put the rule into such hands which may secure to them the ends for which government was at first erected. And they are not to be blamed or punished even this resistance causes disorder or bloodshed since, according to Locke, **if any mischief come in such cases, it is the wrong-doers**, in this case the government causing discontent, **that should be charged**. The people is only trying to bring back the peace and order. While **absolutism** reserves the absolute right of a sovereign who retains all the liberty of the state of nature except with increased power and made licentious by impunity. This is equivalent to avoiding mischiefs that may be done by pole-cats or foxes without any defence from being devoured by lions, as Locke described.

#### Purpose of Government

Locke believes that a political community which embodies the social contract **aims for the mutual preservation of human's nature of being free, equal and independent**. That is to say, it enables human to **leave the state of nature**, and eliminates the uncertainty and chance of constantly being exposed to the invasion of others. For Locke, the purpose of a political community and this state of nature are dialectically related. Since a political community is established because of the inadequacies of the state of nature while at the same time preserve most of the benefits of it.

For Locke, the **state of nature** refers to the estate all human are naturally in, and that is, a state of perfectly **freedom** to order their actions, and dispose of their possessions and person as they think fit, within the bounds of the law of nature. The essential quality of this state is **equality**, as all the power and jurisdiction is reciprocal, no one having more than another, there being nothing more evident than that creatures of the same species and rack, promiscuously born to all the same advantages of Nature, and the use of the same faculties.

However, for Locke, without establishing some sort of social contract or a political community, the above **state of liberty is inadequate** since the moral conception or fundamental law of the state of nature which is the freedom to act without violating another's rights is not properly enforced. As a result, in a state of nature the powers in it are not limited, everyone may interpret for himself what the law of nature requires and may use force in self-defense; all may enforce the law of nature and punish those who break it; and those whose rights are violated may seek reparation from the wrong-doer, others may aid victims in seeking reparation. Additionally, it's quite possible to incur tendencies to degenerate the state of nature into a state of war in which either one person seeks to take the life of another, or one person seeks to put another in his absolute power for no one's life is secure when subject to another's arbitrary will.

The political community **preserves most of the benefit of the state of nature** as well, in a more peaceful and stable way, including the preservation of life, liberty, and property. Because there're established, settled, known law, received and allowed by common consent to be the standard of right and wrong; there's also known and indifferent judge and reliable power to back and support the sentence when right, and to give it due execution. So the social contract, according to Locke, avoids the inadequacies of the state of nature while preserving most of the benefits and liberty except two original powers: 1. of acting howsoever he will consistent with is own interpretation of the law of nature 2. of enforcing the law of nature.

#### Private Property

Locke defends individual property on the basis of **individual rights**, that is, it's an integral therefore indispensable part of people's **natural rights as free and equal individuals**.

Firstly, every individual is **equal** because, according to Locke, "it is very clear that God... 'has given the earth to the children of men,' given it to mankind in common". And human-beings are the craftsmanship of one omnipotent and infinitely wise Maker; all the servants of one sovereign Master; they are His property, whose workmanship they are made to last during His, not another's pleasure. So any subordination among people that may authorize some to destroy another as if they were made for another's uses should be prohibited. As a result, every individual has a property in her own 'person'.

Based on this natural equality of humanity, Locke subsequently proposed the **theory of labour-mixing** which essentially states that the labour of her body and the work of her hands are properly hers. Whatsoever she removes out of the state that Nature has provided and left in it, she has mixed her labour with it, and joined to it something that is her own, and thereby righteously makes it her property. For this labour being the unquestionable property of the labourer, no one but she can have the right over the product of labour.

However, Locke does **impose some limits to the acquisition**, that is, one can take as much as one can make use of to any advantage of life before it spoils, so much she may by her labour fix a property in. And it would be, in the state of nature, a foolish as well as dishonest thing to hoard up more than he could make use of.

## Rousseau

#### State of Nature

For Rousseau, the true state of nature is much **simpler** in which **they are not, by nature, political animals**. Though the people in state of nature is surely more physically fit than us now, they only have **limited passions and appetites** limited to physical needs. Therefore, their desires are limited and easily satisfiable. There is **no language** as well, which naturally leads to the lack of any perceptions of property or justice since there's no differentiation between mine and yours. In such a state, people would have **little need for assistance** nor much motive to offer any. There are also some notable characteristics of human nature that will be found in this state: **amour de soi, compassion, equality and independence**.

**Amour de soi** refers to a natural feeling which leads every animal to look to its own self-preservation. According to Rousseau, desires associated with this feeling are often **non-comparative and naturally bounded** since it will not take infinitely many resources for the mere preservation of one's life. So, this is for Rousseau, the source of prudence and personal virtue which leads to the next goodness he found common in the state of nature, compassion. **Compassion** is an innate repugnance at seeing a fellow creature suffer, and this feeling is not based on self-interest, together with amour de soi they form the simple belief of **"do good to yourself with as little evil as possible to others."** However, it can be impaired by the rational reflection which distance the subjects away from each other. Additionally, people are of necessity **equal** and **independent** as even where there's inequality between people, these have little effect on their relative advantages in the state of nature and it's virtually impossible to force another one to obey in the state of nature because of this equality. So, there's no amour de propre and no drive of superiority.

#### Pathologies of Civil Society and Amour Propre

**Amour Propre**
The **amour propre**, or pride could be traced back to the origin of communities, that is, it **arises once people become socialized and interactive**. According to Rousseau, improvements in reason teach human beings tht others are like themselves and are motivated by amour de soi. This eventually makes mutually beneficial cooperation possible. While this kind of cooperation leads to greater productivity and makes possible the sedentary life and leisure, the former leads to the birth of families bound by ties of affection and later to larger communities united in character and manners which gives rise to the birth of amour propre.

With leisure, people began to devote themselves to assembled activities like singing and dancing. Each one began to consider th rest, and to **wish to be considered in turn**; and thus a value came to be attached to public esteem. Whoever sang or danced best, whoever was the handsomest, the strongest or the more eloquent, came to be of most consideration; and this was the first step towards inequality, and at the same time towards vice. And from this first distinctions arose on the one side **vanity** and **contempt** and on the other **shame** and **envy**: and the fermentation caused by these new leavens ended by producing combinations fatal to innocence and happiness.

Once people came to value the consideration of others, they began to **demand respect**. Any injury one did to another was now more than an injury; it was an insult. Therefore, instead of just trying to deter one another form doing harm, people came to demand revenge to restore their **honor**. Additionally, when an individual began to stand in need of the help of another, their relation naturally becomes more unstable and unequal when property was introduced and **work became indispensable** that leads to **slavery** and **misery** were soon seen to germinate.

**Civil Society**
The inevitable rise of civil society creates **dependence** from which people is no longer free and so to speak, self-sufficient. The rich are in need of the service of others while if poor, then in need of assistance. According to Rousseau, dependence leads to **dissimulation** and **inauthenticity** since it now becomes the interest of people to appear what they really were not. People now have to be perpetually employed in getting others to interest themselves, and in making them find their advantage in promoting themselves.

Compare to individuals in the state of nature who lives within themselves, social people live **constantly outside himself**, being alienated as they only know how to live in the opinions of others, so that they seem to receive the consciousness of their own existence merely from the judgement of others concerning themselves.

These finally lead to the flourishing of **amour propre** that leads to a **desire to dominate** and **conflict**. Since everyone allow oneself to be oppressed so far as they are hurried on by blind ambition and looking rather below than above them. That is, they come to **love the authority more than themselves and independence**; submit to slavery in hope of in turn enslaving others in the future. This irrational desire and insatiable ambition not so much springs from real want or needs but from the desire to surpass others, inducing people with a vile propensity to injure one another, and with a secret jealousy.

The new-born **state of society** thus **gave rise to a horrible state of war**; people thus harassed and depraved were no longer capable of retracting their steps or renouncing the fatal acquisitions that brought themselves to the brink of ruin. This is all because of the emergence of dependence as discussed above, together with sociability and rational reflection that people's amour propre is awakened and her compassion is weakened. This **transformation** is the **root of inequalities**, cruelty, oppression, and misery.

**Critique of Social Contract Ideology**
According to Rousseau, **the poor were seduced** by the formal **legal equality that actually masks and protects social inequality**. The origin of society and law **bounds new fetters on the poor, and gave new powers to the rich**; irretrievably destroyed natural liberty, eternally **fixed the law of property and inequality**, converted clever usurpation into unalterable right, and, for the advantage of a few ambitious individuals, subjected all humanity to perpetual labour, slavery and wretchedness. In sum, inequality of the sort observed in civilized communities is not natural and not suited to our nature.

#### Social Contract
For Rousseau, the key for a just body politic lies **not really in the form of government**, be it a monarchy, an assembly or a direct democracy; instead a true **democratic social contract** or a real sovereignty **that properly represents the popular as a whole** - the **general will**. A democratic social contract - which is essentially a total alienation of each associate, together with all his rights to the whole community, is required because this is for Rousseau a valid solution to the dependence on one another in society which is the cause to amour propre (pride) - the ultimate source of inequalities, cruelty, oppression, and misery. 

This democratic social contract ensures the **true equality** as **each gives himself absolutely**, the conditions are the same for all and no one has any interest in making them burdensome to others, i.e. the social contract properly represents the **general will**, the common good as in Aristotle's polis. This results in a social state that is advantageous wherein all have something and none too much. While the apparent and illusory equality seen under bad governments in which laws are always of use to those who possess and harmful to those who have nothing.

This social contract of general will also ensures each member's **freedom**, since first of all a true equality is established according to the above. And when people unite themselves with all, they may still obey themselves alone, and remain as free as before in the natural state. And because each individual, in giving herself to all, gives herself to nobody; and as there is no associate over whom she does not acquire the same right as she yields others over herself, she gains an equivalent for everything she loses, and an increase of force for the preservation of what she has. As a result, each citizen would be perfectly **independent** of all the rest though they're dependent on the city.

And in order to achieve the true equality, freedom and independence, a **sovereignty** which is the power to make law is necessary to enforce the social contract to be guided by the **general will**. This way, no private individual is above the law but all are bounded by the sovereign - general will. At the same time, the so-called general will must be general in its object as well as its essence, that is, it must both **come from all and apply to all**. Additionally, the will of the community must be expressed in the form of general laws, that is, if citizens are to obey no one but themselves, then **they must make the laws that are to govern them**. Only then can the law represent the popular, the general. 

Accordingly, the **government** should be a commission issued by the sovereign or the general will to apply law to particular circumstances which belongs to the executive power, since the legislative power should include no function which has a particular object. And the sovereign can limit, modify or recover the executive power of the government.

Although for Rousseau, in principle, a **direct democracy** is often dangerous, since there would be no institutional separation of legislative and executive power. Since **the will of the majority may not coincide with the general will**, when one may consider the choice of the community is contrary to the general will, that is, contradictory to one's own prevail, this proves neither more nor less than s/he was mistaken, and that what s/he though to be the general will was not so.

## Tocqueville

#### Individualism

**Community under Aristocracy**
In an state of **Aristocracy**, according to Tocqueville, families remain for centuries in the same condition, on the same spot, which fosters **a sense of community** within one's condition, a sense of dependency on other classes. Therefore, people under the rule of aristocracy are almost always attached to something placed out of their own sphere, and they **often sacrifice themselves for other people**.

**Individualism under Democracy**
However, this is not the case under democracy. Democracy often fosters **individualism** which disposes members of the community to serve themselves from the mass of their fellows and to draw apart with their families and their friends, so that after they have thus formed a little circle of their own, they willingly draw apart with their families and friends. This is, according to Tocqueville, all due to the fact that democracy is marked by **social mobility**.

In such a democratic society, the woof of time is every instant broken and the track of generations effaced. Those who went before are soon forgotten since there's no nobility or aristocracy of prominent names of families that possesses major power in such a democracy. Moreover, due to such a mobility, its **members become undifferentiated and lose their class identity for each other**; that is, democracy breaks the chain that aristocracy had made to chain all members of the community and severs every link of it. And as social conditions become more and more equal, the number of persons, who have retained sufficient education and fortune to satisfy their own wants, increases to a large extent. This group of people, since they don't owe anything to anyone and expect nothing from others, acquire the habit of **always considering themselves as standing alone, and they are apt to imagine that their whole destiny is in their own hands**, which is the ultimate source of individualism.

**Democratic Remedies**
There're majorly two remedies for this kind of individualism geminated in a democratic state, according to Tocqueville, which are respectively the **local politics** and **voluntary associations of civil society**.

**Local politics** in democracy is characterized by its **decentralized** nature, as opposed to the then centralized French politics wherein state affairs are directly managed by a central government or political authority. According to Tocqueville's observations in America, it's difficult to draw people out of their own circles to interest them in the destiny of the state, simply because they don't see any what influence the destiny of the state can have upon their own business. But if it' proposed to make a road across the end of their backyard, they immediately see at a glance that there is a connection between this small public affair and their own private affairs. Therefore, they will discover soonly the close tie that unites every private interest to a general and public one.

Another way of creating community under individualism is by means of energetic **voluntary associations**, and subsequently establish a civil society that serves as an intermediate sphere between the individual family and the state. Tocqueville observed that in America there're so many associations of different kinds - religious, moral, commercial, serious that are either enormous or diminutive. They serve all kinds of goals ranging form giving entertainments, to founding establishments for education. In this manner, they voluntarily form a society, a civil one.

#### Tyranny of the Majority

Tocqueville's deducing the tyranny of the majority is a **syllogistic** one. Since we know that power always creates dangers of abuse, of tyranny. We also know that under direct democracies, social and political institutions are ruled by or directly represent the majority. And since majority has the power now, it's inevitable that they will face the danger of the tyranny, of the majority.

As a result, for Tocqueville, democracy though inevitable and irresistible as various occurrences of national existence have everywhere turned to the advantage of it, the danger of it is particularly acute simply **because the power is so concentrated in the hands of the majority**, which will consequently lead to a more catastrophic tyranny than a king or an emperor. Take, for example, an individual is wronged in such a democratic nation, Tocqueville argues that it's **hardly possible for one to apply for redress**. One cannot appeal to the public opinion, since it constitutes the majority that wronged her. Similarly it's pointless to plead to the legislature as it represents the majority and implicitly obeys it; if to the executive power, it's appointed by the majority and serves as a passive tool in its hand. Moreover, the public force consists of the majority under arms; the jury is the majority invested with the right of hearing judicial cases; So, when coming to the case of mischief done by majority, according to the above reasoning by Tocqueville, there is no way to rectify any wrong decisions.

Additionally, the **freedom of speech** that the democratic America is so proud of, **isn't without its limits and barriers**. If one goes beyond this formidable barrier around the liberty of opinion, then he is, according to Tocqueville exposed to continual obloquy and persecution. Her political career is instantly ended, as she has offended the only authority that is able to start it; then those who blame her criticize so loudly and those who think as she does keep quiet and move away. She cannot do anything but subsides into silence, as if she felt remorse for having spoken the truth. And in such a case, **the body is to be left free while the soul is to be enslaved**. While in a monarchic state, the oppression is materialized: under the absolute sway of one man the body was attacked in order to subdue the soul, but **the soul escaped the blows** which were directed against it **and rose proudly superior**.

## Mill

#### Utilitarianism

First of all, let's take a look at Mill's **definition of happiness** which is an indispensable part of the ultimate goal of utilitarianism. Mill believes that happiness is **intended pleasure and the absence of pain**, whereas unhappiness is pain and the privation of pleasure. However, in his account of utilitarianism, the measurement of this happiness is relatively different from other utilitarianists like Bentham. Bentham counted only the **intensity** and **duration** of pleasure and pain as factors in defining happiness, while Mill adds the **quality** of pleasure as a factor. That is to say, even you consider yourself happy because of some activities that generate intense and long-lasted euphoria, if it's not of great quality - in the sense that it's not of more creative or intellectual, it cannot be counted toward true happiness and is considered inferior to those happiness that are considered **objective** and **perfectionist**.

For Mill, the **basis** for utilitarianism is threefold. The first being **individual prudence** which aims to **maximize one's own long-term happiness**. So, the satisfaction of some instant and uncomplicated happiness isn't always desirable according to this account. The second idea being the **nature of morality** that involves an **impartial point of view**, that is, one shouldn't only involve a particular point of view locally but rather should consider a more complete account over an issue. The final element being the **fundamental principle of morality** which aims to **maximize the aggregate happiness of all**. That is, the standard morality which is basically the rules and precepts for human conduct, should always direct to the greatest extent possible, not only to all humanity, but to the whole sentient creation. Only this way, the general happiness is said to be maximized.

Mill's utilitarianism also retains the perfect **rationality** as long as happiness remains quantifiable and can be compared. So many moral disagreements which all seem like irresolvable conflict of intuitions can all be successfully tackled by this utilitarian and rational account. Since for Mill, once utilitarianism is adopted, all moral questions become matters for **empirical enquiry**, and reduce to a simple question: what will maximize the general welfare and happines?

#### Harm Principle, Liberty
Mill's harm principle states that, "the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to **prevent harm to others**." This principle, to Mill's belief, should govern absolutely the dealings of society with the individual in the way of compulsion and control, whether the means used be physical force in the form of legal penalties, or the moral coercion of public opinion.

This harm principle is essentially **against paternalism and moralism**, since the external intervention shouldn't forcibly exercise over one who does no harm to others. This is to say, one's own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant and she cannot possibly be compelled rightfully to do or forbear. For example, if an individual is doing something that is, in others' opinions, unwisely contrary to her own interest or some common moral conceptions, no one could compel or visit her with any evil but reason with or persuade her. Therefore, it's obvious to see that, for Mill, **the only part of the conduct** of anybody, for which they're amenable to society, **is that which concerns others**. In the part which merely concerns themselves, their independence is rightfully absolute. Consequently, **over oneself, over one's own body and mind, the individual is sovereign**.

It would seem that sometimes liberty and utility are contradictory to each other, and the happiness of all is best promoted by restricting members' liberty in certain cases. But Mill denies it by saying that he regards **utility as the ultimate appeal on all ethical questions**, and this **utility must be in the largest sense and grounded on the permanent interests of humanity as a progressive being**. Those ethical questions, for Mill, authorize the subjection of individual spontaneity to external intervention only when one's action concerns the interest of the others'. This is to say that liberty should only be infringed to protect others against harm.

#### Free Discussion

For Mill, the freedom of speech is necessary and at the same time compatible with utilitarianism, since free speech permits the **discovery of new truths** and **reinforces our understanding of the true opinions** we already had. Whenever there are disagreement and arguments, even it's the case in which all people minus one, were of one opinion and only one person were of the contrary view, neither of the parties is justified properly to silence the other even if one party is overwhelmingly more powerful politically than the other. And in this case, according to Mill, there're simply three possibilities.

The first possibility being the opinion which is attempted to be suppressed by authority may possibly be true. Those who desire to suppress it, of course deny its truth; but they're not infallible. However, to refuse hearing an opposite opinion, because they believe its falsity, is to assume that their certainty is absolute since all silencing of discussion is an assumption of infallibility, which is absurd. Therefore, this suppression cannot be right. Moreover, the whole strength and value of human judgement relies on whether the means of setting it right are kept constantly at hand, and the suppression only indicates the loss of this tool that enables one's mind to be open to criticism.

The second case being that the authority or common view is true. Similar to someone who even possesses a strong opinion may readily admit to the possibility of her view being wrong, however true it may be, if it's not fully, frequently, and fearlessly discussed, it will be held as a dead dogma, not a living truth. Also, people in this situation, even they hold the true opinion, they may do so only accidentally without understanding in full or hardly know why it's true at all.

The final possibility which is also the most common one, is both sides may have some part being true. In this case, the nonconforming opinion is to supply the remainder of the truth, of which the whatever received doctrine embodies only partially.

#### Individuality

According to Mill, individuality is essential in a limited government, since it **facilitates not only personal well-being**, but also **socially beneficial experiments in living**.

It's important to individuals since human nature is not a machine to be built after a model, and set to do exactly the work prescribed for it, but for Mill, is **a tree which requires to grow and develop itself on all sides**, according to the tendency of the inward forces which make it a living thing. And only this tree-like cultivation of individuality is capable of producing well-developed human beings. Mill adds that a person only develops her intellectual powers by leading her own life and **one's own mode** of laying out her existence is the best, not because it's the best in itself, but because it's her own mode, accordingly, to give any fair play to the nature of each, it's essential that different persons should be allowed to lead different lives.

The individuality and liberty in general also **encourages experiments in life** that are beneficial. For as discussed above, human are not infallible since their truths are often only half-truths, a unity of opinion which is resulted from external intervention, unless sprung from the fullest and freest comparison of opposite opinions, is not desirable since they're often incomplete. Therefore, different opinions are required for a person's well-being, likewise, the different experiments of living should be encouraged as well, that free scope should be given to varieties of character, short of injury to others; and that the worth of different modes of life should be proved practically, when any one thinks fit to try them.

Therefore, in both cases, individuality and liberty is **beneficial to each member of society in long run**. According to Mill, **the worth of a state is the worth of the individuals composing it** in the long run, since it's virtually impossible for dwarfed citizens to accomplish great things as their individuality and agency are not cultivated and fostered. As a result, in the long run, liberty is beneficial and ultimately conform to the principle of utilitarianism.

**Against Government Intervention**
Mill's argument for the defense of personal liberty and **against state interference** is that often individuals do things better than the government would, but even when they wouldn't, doing things themselves develops their powers as means to their own mental education. Additionally, the worth of a state, in long run, is the worth of the individuals composing it since with oppressed people no great thing can really be accomplished.

## Hegel

#### Objective Freedom

The **mutual recognition**, in which each knows one's own freedom because it's recognized by another free being with rational will, **gives rise to objective freedom**. This conception of freedom by Hegel is **positive** in the sense that freedom consists in rational **self-determination**, rather than the absence of constraints.

Objective or rational freedom has its concrete existence in **right** which encompasses both law and custom. And this is the **root of all true spiritual life**, the basis of all true community, as opposed to the one built on force. These various forms of community have their own logic and their own rational orderings. These forms of concrete, rationally ordered, collective life can be regarded as **objective spirit**.

Hegel regards **objective spirit as more substantial than the subjective spirit** of the individual. That is, we only fully realize our nature in the life of objective spirit, be that the family, the nation, etc. In turn, **the spirit**, or culture, or a community **shapes the consciousness of the individual from within** - the person feels that underlying essence to be one's own very being looks upon it as one's absolute final aim. This way people perform their duty as their own and in this necessity they have themselves and their actual freedom.

#### Modern Society and Freedom
For Hegel, modern society is conducive to freedom since it is distinctive in that it **synthesizes objective and subjective freedom**. The **former** is defined as being **governed by rational laws**, even if one does not endorse those laws oneself, **that promotes freedom**. The **later** means to be free to **act without being subject to any alien will**, and to find personal satisfaction in one's action. The modern society is superior than historical ones in the sense that historical societies all tended to favor one or the other, of perhaps extending subjective freedom to some people (the rich and elite), while offering objective freedom to others (the people).

The right of subjective freedom, is the pivotal and focal point in the difference between antiquity and the modern age. And this right, in its infinity, is expressed in Christianity, and it has become the universal and actual principle of a new form of the world.

**Social Differentiation**
For Hegel, the key to make fully-actualized freedom possible in the modern world is the **differentiation of spheres**. In primitive societies, there is no distinction between family, economy, and state. And throughout most of history, there was no autonomous economic sphere or so-called civil society.

While in modern society, the **family** is separated from the economic sphere and politics, and is characterized by love and provides an immediate sense of meaning and belonging. The market economy or **civil society** is now separated from the family and direct political authority, which becomes at once a sphere of individual self-definition and self-esteem and recognition of broader social interdependency. And lastly, the **state** which preserves the freedom of all, is now the object of patriotic identification - a sense of identifying with the whole nation, something larger and more permanent than the individual or family.

#### The Role of State, Civil Society

**Police/Government Power**
Although the **family** and the **economy** are independent spheres of society with their own logics, they **need direction and regulation**. The state has police powers to regulate these independent spheres so that they operate effectively. For example, if parents are not properly raising their children, the state can step in to intervene. Another example is that the state may regulate the economy so that it fulfills its function. **However**, the state **should not override the internal logic of these independent spheres**.

**Corporation**
Additionally, Hegel recognized that people cannot always satisfy their needs by working in the economy. Since it's possible that a person is injured or there may be an economic crisis that throws him out of work. For this reason, every occupation out to be associated with a corporation, or **guild**, or **trade association**. And it is the responsibility of the corporation to provide relief. When relief comes from one's trade association, one's honour is preserved since the aid is seen as part of one's due for the contributions one has made, it's not simply a handout from the state.

However, Hegel sees a problem on the horizon: modern division of labor may create a class of **unskilled workers**, who earn low wages and lack any pride in their work. This gives rise to a **dangerous rabble**. So the state should try to discourage the creation of such a class through its police powers.

#### Constitution

**Progressive History**
All genuine communities are based on **mutual recognition** and a conception of **objective freedom**. That is, a true community embodies a moral bond while it's not held together by pure force. However, in almost all existing communities, objective freedom is only imperfectly actualized.

History is progressive in that it embodies the **gradual unfolding** and development **of rational freedom**. And through this, we can see that there is a **world spirit coming to self-consciousness as rational freedom is progressively actualized**. Although the development of history is rational, it typically proceeds by violent convulsions instigated by ambitious individuals who have no insight into what they are doing.

**Relativist and Universalist Constitution**
For Hegel, the lives of individuals are embedded in communities like families and nations. These communities are always **whole organized** according to certain conceptions of Right, that is, they're **not aggregates of individuals**. Therefore, it's confused to think that we can simply impose a conception of justice, a constitution, or fundamental law on a community. Here, Hegel takes on a relativist point of view, he believes that **a constitution only develops from the national spirit identically with that spirit's own development**, and runs through at the same time with it the grades of formation and the alterations required by its concept. And it is the indwelling spirit and the history of the nation by which constitutions have been and are made. That is to say, for Hegel, the constitution of a state is not to be simply made, but it **should be spontaneously rooted in the national spirit, developed by its own character and history towards the end of objective freedom**.

## Marx

#### Critique of Capitalist Society

For Marx, **alienation** and **exploitation** are inherent in the capitalist system of private property and wage labour. Since capitalism create large-scale, socialized production and inevitably simplify the **class antagonisms** to a single cleavage: bourgeoisie and proletariat, where the proletariat is the class of wage-labourers who possesses no means of production, and the bourgeoisie is the class of capitalists owning those productive forces. These two groups are struggling and stand in constant opposition to one another because of the enormous **inequality** in-between which is quintessential of all class conflict throughout the history.

There’s inherent antagonism between the proletariat and bourgeoisie because the former is stripped of individuality and species-life by the later to become merely a mean to the ever-increasing capital and accumulated labour force in a capitalist society. That is, in the modern capitalist production environment, workers are realized in the **objectification** of their labour. According to Marx, this objectification is essentially something **alien** and external since workers don’t own their labour and the end products produced by themselves. This estrangement from the product and the activity of labouring consequently leads to the **alienation of the species-beings** as they suffer from the loss of humanity or species-characters consisting of free and conscious activity, they produce only under the dominion of physical subsistence just like any other animals and are deprived of the right to produce actively and intellectually since they don’t have other choice than passively and mechanically replicating themselves into the external and inanimate objects of products. This finally leads to the **estrangement** from the worker **to her/his own kind** as all the value they produce serves merely as the fuel to the capitalist machine that will exploit them so far as they’re paid by the minimum quantum of the means of subsistence to keep them in bare existence as labourers, benefiting only a small portion of people of capitalists who eventually become an alien and hostile force confronting the workers. And this serves as the **ultimate cause of class antagonisms**.

#### Communism

**Abolishment of private property** and all the conditions for class antagonisms. Communism transforms capital, which is the collectively produced means of production which enable the owner to command the labour of others, into social property. The **proletariat** will be raised to the position of **ruling class** from working class, and use this newly acquired political supremacy to wrest, by degree, all capital from the bourgeoisie, to **centralize all instruments of production** in the hands of the state, and to increase the total productive forces as rapidly as possible.

**By sweeping away this old conditions of production, the proletarian revolution will also sweep away the conditions for class and class antagonisms.** Once class distinctions have disappeared, and all production has been concentrated in the hands of a vast association of the whole nation, the public power will lose its political character which is merely the organized power of one class for oppressing another. And **in place of the old bourgeois society, we shall have an association in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all**. 

**Retain from Capitalism**
However, during the transitional phase of communist society, the individual producer receives back from society - after deductions have been made - exactly what he gives to it, this **equal right of workers is still an individualistic, bourgeois principle**, albeit freed form the exploitation. Since all do not have an equal capacity for labour, nor do all have equal needs. Thus this equal right is an unequal right for unequal labour. Though it recognizes no class differences, because everyone is only a worker like everyone else, it tacitly recognizes unequal individual endowment, and thus productive capacity, as a natural privilege.

#### Principles of distribution

**Transitional phase of communist society**
Labour without exploitation, the individual producer receives back from society - after deductions have been made - exactly what he gives to it.

**Higher phase of community society**
An ethos of solidarity: after **labour has become** not only a means of life but **life's prime want**; after the productive forces have also increased with the all-around development of the individual, and all the springs of co-operative wealth flow more abundantly - only then can **the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be crossed in its entirety and society inscribe on its banners: from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs**.

Distribution is ultimately secondary: it's a mistake to make a fuss about so-called distribution and put the principal stress on it. **Any distribution** whatever of the means of consumption **is only a consequence of the distribution of the conditions of production themselves**.

## Du Bois

#### Self-Conscious Manhood

**The Merge**
According to Du Bois, African American people strive to attain self-conscious manhood, by merging one's double self into a **better and truer self** such that they're no longer shut out from the world by a **vast veil**, and they no longer possess **double consciousness** by which they always look at themselves through the eyes of others, and measure the soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity. And during this merging, one **wishes neither of the older selves to be lost**. She would not Africanize America, for America has too much to teach the world and Africa. She would not bleach her African soul in a flood of white Americanism, for she knows that African blood has a message for the world. She simply wishes to make it possible for an individual **to be both an African and an American**, without being cursed and spit upon by her fellows, without having the doors of opportunity closed in the face.

#### Freedom

**The Pursuit**
Away back in the days of bondage, they sought to see in one divine event the end of all doubt and disappointment. Few people ever worshipped freedom with half such unquestioning faith as did the African American people for centuries. To people, **slavery was indeed the sum of all villainies, the cause of all sorrow, the root of all prejudice**, and **emancipation** is the key to a promised land.

**Work, Culture, Liberty**
The bright ideals of the past, physical freedom, political power, the training of brains and the training of hands, all these ideals must be melted and welted into one. **Work, culture, liberty, all these we need, not singly but together**, each growing and aiding each, and all striving toward that vaster ideal that swims before the African people, the ideal of human brother hood, gained thought the **unifying ideal of race**; the ideal of fostering and developing the traits and talents of the African people, not in opposition to or contempt for other races, but rather in large conformity to the greater ideals of the American Republic, in order that some day on American soil two world-races may give each to each those characteristics both so sadly lack. That is, **to be a co-worker in the kingdom of culture**.

#### Critique of America and Europe

The WWI in which white men are fighting against each other under essentially equal conditions, equal armament, and equal waste of wealth, according to Du Bois, is not because Europe gone mad; this is not aberration nor insanity; this is, so to speak, the **necessary condition of modern Europe** which is based off of the real soul of white culture – **colonialism**. Here, Du Bois added to Marxist critique of capitalist society of creating great inequalities between different economic strata of society, and emphasized the **inevitable outcome of capitalism** which is the colonialism, geminated from the insatiable **search for cheap materials and labor**.

From above, according to Du Bois, the root cause of the war was colonialism. More specifically, Germany's aggression stemmed from its feeling penned in by the Western European powers that had already laid claim to so much of the world. **Colonialism** creates so much profit because the labor in the colonies could be kept cheap by dehumanizing people of color, and colonial administration could, likewise, be justified by asserting the superiority of whites over the colored races. Thus, the world market most wildly and desperately sought today is the market where labor is cheapest and most helpless and profit is most abundant. This exploitation of cheap labor could, in turn, be used to benefit the working classes at home, thus staving off class conflict.

#### Democracy

For Du Bois, the central case for democracy rests on the idea that **each person is the best judge of one's own needs and problems**. He further proposed that **industrial democracy,** or socialism which opposed the conditions of oppression in industrial society, is the next stage of the democratic idea. Additionally, he advocates for **minority representation** since majority rules poses a danger to permanent minorities, therefore the more democratic solution is proportional representation.

**Industrial Democracy**
For Du Bois, the **ruling** of people **is the effort to direct the individual actions of many persons toward some end**, and theoretically should be the **greatest good of all**. The ideal of 18th century democracy was that if all ruled they would rule for all, and thus universal good was sought through universal suffrage, however, the industrial revolution has challenged this kind of democracy by introducing an expansive real of private government that permits a few to direct industry to their own good. So, for him, we should try democratic rule in a new way against the new industrial oppression and the direction of individual action in industry should be securing the greatest good of all.

**Majority**
However, one may argue that the majority of people don't have the knowledge to manage the industrial process, and their interests will be better served if left to those who are wiser and more experienced. Du Bois denies this claim by insisting that the best case for democracy is that **no one knows his own needs and sufferings better than that person herself**. Du Bois believes that in the people we have the source of **endless life** and **unbounded wisdom** which the rulers must have, so the above argument is not an excuse for excluding them but instead, it should be an argument for educating and giving them experience. For through a democratic government that recognizes, not only the worth of the individual to oneself, but the worth of her/his feelings and experiences to all, they can educate, not only the individual unit, but generation after generation, until they accumulate vast stores of wisdom.

For Du Bois, the **democratization** comes not complete by instant revolution of a day, it **comes daily, bit by bit and step by step**, as people learn and grow and as children are trained in truth.

**Minority**
A traditional view is that the first duty of a minority is to become a majority, but some minorities like the racial ones cannot hope to become majorities. So, a **proportional representation** and requiring political decisions to involve the input of minorities.

## Rawls

#### Rejection of Utilitarianism

For Rawls, utilitarianism fails to attribute enough importance to **basic rights and liberties**, but treats them as merely one contributor to the general welfare. And because of utilitarianists' wrong conception of rights, this leads to the conditions for **unfair distribution**, as they're primarily concerned with **aggregate welfare**, pay no special attention to the cases, in which imposing hardships on the less advantaged to benefit the more advantaged.

According to Rawls, **each person possesses an inviolability founded on justice that even the welfare of society as a whole cannot override**. For this reason, justice denies that the loss of freedom for some is made right by a greater good shared by others. It does not allow that the sacrifices imposed on a few are outweighed by the larger sum of advantages enjoyed by many. Therefore in a just society the liberties of equal citizenship are taken as settled; **the rights secured by justice are not subject to political bargaining** or to the calculus of social interests.

#### Social Contract

**The Equal Liberty Principle / The State of Nature**
Each person is to have an **equal right** to the most extensive scheme of **equal basic liberties** compatible with a similar scheme of liberties for others. So, the positions and offices to which the people attach or from which they may be gained should be open to all under conditions of **fair equality of opportunity**.

**The Original Position**
In order to ensure the equal liberty and opportunity, Rawls proposes that the **principles of justice** are those that free and equal individuals would choose from the **original position** in which a **veil of ignorance** prevents them knowing their own social station, their natural assets, or their own conceptions of the good, or plans of life. Only in this way, the original choice situation can be fair since no one can choose principles of justice that favor her/his own special circumstances.

As a result, in the original position, utilitarianism would not be preferred since it's only appealing to maximize expected value, we should according to Rawls care deeply about being **able to pursue one's own conception of the good**.

**The Difference Principle / general will**
Rawls argues that social and economic inequalities are to be arranged so that they are both **to everyone's advantage and especially the least advantaged**. According to Rawls, we don't earn the socioeconomic privileges and disadvantages attached to our starting point in society, and even a peron's superior character that gives him a good work ethic depends in good part upon fortunate family and social circumstances in early life for which we can take no credit. Therefore, the **difference principle** represents, in effect, an agreement to **regard the distribution of natural talents as in some respects a common asset** and to share in the greater social and economic benefits made possible by the complementarities of this distribution. Those who have been favored by nature, whoever, they are, **may gain from their good fortune only on terms that improves the situation of those who have lost out**.

Rawls favors the basic idea of the social contract: what sorts of arrangements could we justify to one another and agree upon. This is to appeal, not to impartiality, but to **reciprocity**.
