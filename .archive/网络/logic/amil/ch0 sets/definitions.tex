A \textit{set} is a collection of things, called its members or elements. \newline

We write $x = y$ to mean that $x$ and $y$ are the same object. If $A = B$, then for any object t it is automatically true that $t \in A$ \textit{iff} $t \in B$. This holds simply because $A$ and $B$ are the same thing.

\label{sub:Principle of Extensionality}

If A and B are sets such that for every object t, $$t \in A \quad\textrm{iff}\quad t \in B,$$ then $A = B$. This reflects the idea of what a set is; \textbf{a set is determined just by its members.}
