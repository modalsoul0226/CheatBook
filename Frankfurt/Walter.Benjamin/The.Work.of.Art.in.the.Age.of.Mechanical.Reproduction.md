## Foreword
... In all arts there is a physical component that cannot continue to be considered and treated in the same way as before... Neither matter nor **space** nor **time** is what, up until twenty years ago, it always was. We must be prepared for such profound changes to alter the entire technological aspect of the arts, influencing invention itself as a result, and eventually, it may be, contriving to **alter the very concept of art** in the most magical fashion. -- Paul Valery, Pieces sur l'art.


## I
In principle, the work of art has **always** been reproducible. What man has made, man has always been able to make again...

Technological reproduction of the work of art is something else, something that has been practised intermittently throughout history, at **widely separated intervals** though **with growing intensity**:
- Greeks - casting and embossing: bronzes, terracotta and coins.
- wood engraving: made graphic art technologically reproducible for the first time.
- Middle age - copperplate engraving and etching.
- Early nineteenth century - lithography
- Mere decades after - photography - in the process of pictorial reproduction the ***hand*** was for the first time relieved of the principal artistic responsibilities.

Around 1900 technological reproduction had reached a standard at which it had not merely begun to take the totality of tradition artworks as its province, imposing the most profound changes on the impact of such works; it had even gained a place for itself among artistic modes of procedure.


## II
...the **here** and **now** of the work of art -- its unique existence in the place where it is at this moment...

history: 1. physical structure over the course of time 2. the fluctuating conditions of ownership

The here and now of the original constitute the abstract idea of its **genuineness**.

The whole province of genuineness is beyond technological reproducibility. But while in relation to manual reproduction the **genuine** article keeps its full **authority**, in relation to **reproduction** by technological means that is **not** the case:

1. A technological reproduction is **more autonomous**. For example, through photography, it is able to employ techniques like enlargement or slow motion to capture images that are quite simply byond natural optics.
2. It can place the copy of the original in situations **beyond the reach of the original itself**. Above all, it makes it possible for the original to come closer to the person taking it in.
