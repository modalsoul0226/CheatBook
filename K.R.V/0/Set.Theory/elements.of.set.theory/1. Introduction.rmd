## 1.1 Baby Set Theory

### Principle of Extensionality

If two sets have exactly the same members, then they are equal.

If $A$ and $B$ are sets such that for every object $t$, \[
    t \in A \quad\text{iff}\quad t \in B,
\] then $A=B$.

### Empty Set

The set $\emptyset$ has no members at all. It is **the only set with no members**, since *extensionality* tells us that any two such sets must coincide.

### Pair Set

For any objects $x$ and $y$, we can form the pair set $\{x,y\}$ having just the members $x$ and $y$. Observe that $\{x,y\}=\{y,x\}$, as both sets have exactly the same members.

### Union

The **union** of sets $A$ and $B$ is the set $A\cup B$ of all things that are members of $A$ or $B$ (or both).

### Intersection

The **intersection** of $A$ and $B$ is the set $A\cap B$ of all things that are members of both $A$ and $B$. Set $A$ and $B$ are said to be **disjoint** when they have no common memebers, i.e., when $A \cap B=∅$.

### Subset

A set $A$ is said to be a \textit{subset} of a set $B$ iff all the members of $A$ are also memebers of $B$. Note that **any set is a subset of itself. $\emptyset$ is a subset of every set**. If $A \subseteq B$, then we also say that $A$ is \textit{included} in $B$ or that $B$ contains \textit{A}.

### Power Set

Any set $A$ will have **one or more subsets**. If $A$ has $n$ elements, then $A$ has $2^{n}$ subsets. A *power set* of $A$ is the set of all subsets of $A$:
\[
    \mathcal{P} A = \{x\,|\,x \subseteq A\}
\]

> Numerology: A positive integer is \textit{perfect} if it equals the sum of its smaller divisors, e.g. $6=1+2+3$. The first four perfect numbers are 6, 28, 496, and 8128.

## 1.2 Sets – An Informal View

\end{figure}

The ordinals are the backbone of the universe: $V_{α+1} = 𝒫 V_{α}$ (figure \ref{fig:ordinals}).

## 1.3 Classes

Collection of sets:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{The Zermelo-Fraenkel} alternative: The collection of all sets need have no ontological status at all, and we need never speak of it.
	\item \textit{The von Neumann-Bernays} alternative: The collection of all sets can be called a \textit{class}. Similarly any other collection of sets can be called a class. Informally, a class $A$ is a set if it it included in some level $V_{α}$ of our hierarchy. Otherwise it is not a set, and can never be a member of a set.
\end{itemize}

## 1.4 Axiomatic Method

Mathematical objects (e.g. numbers and differentiable functions) can be defined to be certain sets. And the theorems of mathematics (e.g. fundamental theorem of calculus) then can be viewed as statements about sets.

Our axiom system begins with two \textit{primitive notions}, the concept of \textbf{set} and \textbf{member}. In terms of these concepts we will define others, but **the primitive notions remain undefined**.

Then we adopt a list of \textit{axioms} concerning the primitive notions, and proceed to derive sentences that are \textit{logical consequences / theorems} of the axioms.

A sentence $\sigma$ is said to be a logical consequence of the aximos if **any** assignment of meaning to the undefined notions of set and member making the axioms true also makes $\sigma$ true.

> If $\sigma$ is a logical consequence of a list of axioms, there is a finitely long \textit{proof} of $\sigma$ from the axioms under a reasonable definition of "proof."

## 1.5 Historical Notes

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Cantor}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Originated the theory of abstract sets.
		\item Proved that the set of all real numbers could not be put into one-to-one correspondence with the integers (Theorem 6B) in December of 1873.
		\item Setting forth the general concepts of abstract sets and \textit{transfinite numbers}.
		\begin{description}
			\item[Note] There was no objection to a \textit{potential infinity} in the form of an unending process, but an \textit{actual infinity} in the form of \textbf{a completed infinite set} was harder to accept.
		\end{description}
	\end{itemize}

	\item \textbf{Frege}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Attempt to present the principles of set theory as being principles of logic, i.e. as self-evident truths of deductive truth.
	\end{itemize}

	\item \textbf{Russell}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The simplicity and the directness of Russell's paradox seemd to destroy utterly the attempt to base mathematics on the sort of set theory that Frege has proposed.
	\end{itemize}

	\item \textbf{Ernst Zermelo}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Published the first axiomatization of set theory in 1908.
		\item His axioms were essentially the ones stated in Chapter 2 and 4.
	\end{itemize}

	\item \textbf{Abraham Fraenkel}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Proposed the axiom of replacement (Chapter 7) to strengthen Zermelo's axioms, giving rise to the \textit{Zermelo-Fraenkel} axioms.
	\end{itemize}

	\item \textbf{von Neumann}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Formulated an axiomatization admitting proper classes as legitimate objects in 1925.
		\item Explicitly included the axiom of regularity or foundation (Chapter 7) in the 1925 paper.
	\end{itemize}

	\item \textbf{Paul Bernays}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Utilized some of von Neumann's ideas in the development of a more satisfactory axiomatization.
	\end{itemize}

	\item \textbf{Godel}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Modified Bernay's axioms in a 1940 monograph.
		\item The approach is now known as \textit{von Neumann-Bernays} VNB or \textit{Godel-Bernays}  GB set theory.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
