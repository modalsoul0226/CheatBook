## Stack
Stack is a **linear data structure** which follows FILO in which the operations are performed:

### Performance
- push: O(1)
- pop: O(1)

---
## Queue
A Queue is a **linear structure** which follows FIFO in which the operations are performed. The difference between [stacks](#stack) and queues is in **removing**. In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added.
