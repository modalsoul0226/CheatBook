## Overview

**Jorge Francisco Isidoro Luis Borges Acevedo** (24 August 1899 – 14 June 1986) was an Argentine short-story writer, essayist, poet and translator, and a key figure in [Spanish-language](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Spanish_literature "Spanish literature") and international literature. His best-known books, Ficciones and El Aleph, published in the 1940s, are compilations of short stories interconnected by common themes, including dreams, labyrinths, philosophers, libraries, mirrors, fictional writers, and mythology. Borges's works have contributed to [philosophical literature](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Philosophical_literature "Philosophical literature") and the [fantasy](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Fantasy "Fantasy") genre, and have been considered by some critics to mark the beginning of the [magic realist](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Magic_realist "Magic realist") movement in 20th century Latin American literature. His late poems converse with such cultural figures as [Spinoza](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Spinoza "Spinoza"), [Camões](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Lu%C3%ADs_de_Cam%C3%B5es "Luís de Camões"), and [Virgil](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Virgil "Virgil").
