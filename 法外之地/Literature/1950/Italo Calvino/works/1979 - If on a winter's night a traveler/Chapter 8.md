# Chapter 8 / 第八章
> Part of [[If on a winter's night a traveler]]

---
> [[Publishing Industry]], [[Advertising Industry]], [[Artificial Intelligence]]

- Strange people circulate in this valley: <u>**literary agents** awaiting my new novel, for which they have already collected advances from publishers all over the world; **advertising agents** who want my characters to wear certain articles of clothing and drink certain fruit juices; **electronic technicians** who insist on finishing my unfinished novels with a computer.</u> I try to go out as little as possible; I avoid the village; if I want to take a walk, I choose the mountain trails.

> [[UFO]]

- Today I ran into a party of boys who looked like scouts, excited and yet meticulous, arranging some pieces of canvas on a meadow to form geometric patterns.

	- "Signals for planes?" I asked.

	- "For flying saucers," they answered. "We're UFO observers. This is a place of transit, a kind of aerial track that has seen a lot of activity lately. <u>They think it's because a writer is living somewhere around here, and the inhabitants of the other planets want to use him for communication."</u>

	- "What makes you believe that?" I asked.

	- “The fact is that for some time this writer has been undergoing a crisis and can't write any more. The newspapers are wondering what the reason can be. According to our calculations, it could be the inhabitants of other worlds keeping him inactive, so that he will be drained of terrestrial conditionings and become receptive."

> [[Writing]], [[Authorship]]

- "But why him, particularly?"

- "<u>The extraterrestrials can't say things directly. They have to express themselves in an indirect way, a figurative way—for example, through stories that arouse unusual emotions.</u> This writer apparently has a good technique and a certain elasticity of ideas."

- "But have you read his books?"

- "What he has written so far is of no interest. The book he will write when he emerges from the crisis is the one that could contain the <u>cosmic communications</u>."

- "Transmitted to him how?"

- "Mentally. <u>He shouldn't even be aware of it. He would believe he is writing as he likes; instead, **the message coming from space on waves picked up by his brain would infiltrate what he is writing.**</u>"

- "And would you succeed in decoding the message?"

- They did not answer me.

- When I think that the interplanetary expectation of these young people will be disappointed, I feel a certain sorrow. After all, I could easily slip into my next book something that might seem to them the revelation of a cosmic truth. For the present I have no idea of what I might invent, but if I start writing, an idea will come to me.

- <u>What if it were as they say? If, while I believe I am writing in fun, what I write were really dictated by the extraterrestrials?</u>
