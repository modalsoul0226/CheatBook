		- For any entity $x$, we can form the [[singleton set]] $\{x\}$, whose only member is $x$
			- **Notice** that $x$ is not the same thing as $\{x\}$, and this is itself not the same as $\{\{x\}\}$
			- However, we do have $x \in \{x\} \in \{\{x\}\}$
		- Another special set is the [[empty set]], often written as $\emptyset$.
			- Again, $$\emptyset$$ is not the same thing as $$\{\emptyset\}$$

		- Suppose S is the set of UoE students, C the set of UoE
		  courses. We can now form many sets such as . . .
			- $\{ (s, t) \in$ S × S | $s$ and $t$ are taking the same courses $\}$
			- $\{ (s, c) \in$ S × C | student $s$ is taking course $c$ $\}$
			- $\{ (x,y) \in \mathbb{Z}$ | $x<y \}$

		- [[List Comprehension]] is a powerful means of constructing lists in Haskell.
		- with the set:
		- $$\{ x^2 \,|\, x \in \mathbb{Z}, -3 \leq x \leq 3 \}$$
		- we have the list:
		- ```haskell
		  [ x*x | x <- [-3..3]]
		  ```
		- Whereas the first of these defines the set $\{0,1,4,9\}$, the second produces the list `[9, 4, 1, 9, 1, 4, 9]`

		- Suppose $A$ and $B$ are sets, a function from $A$ to $B$ is a way of associating a member of $B$ with each element of $A$.
		- If $x \in A$, we write $f(x)$ for the associated member of $B$
			- define $f: \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ by $f(x) = x^2 + 5$
		- ((63df4bae-8e23-4a11-ae16-990d770078d7))
			- Suppose both $f$, $g$ are functions $A \rightarrow B$. We consider $f$, $g$ to be equal if they associate the same member of $B$ to each member of $A$:
			- $$f=g \text{ if for every } x \in A \text{ we have } f(x)=g(x)$$

- ## Set Theory vs. Type Theory vs. Category Theory
	- #maths #set #type-theory #category-theory
	- Reference: [Stack Exchange - J D](https://philosophy.stackexchange.com/a/87035)
	- **Naive set theory** is the theory historically by [[Gottlob Frege]] to show that all mathematics reduces to logic.
	- **Type theory** was proposed and developed by [[Bertrand Russell]] and others to put a restriction on set theory to avoid [[Russell's paradox]], and which was then replaced by [[ZF]] and [[ZFC]], but still finds popularity among computer language designers.
	- **Category theory** has been offered as an alternative to ZFC as a foundational theory, which is powerful in analyzing the functional aspects of mathematical structures and might be seen as an abstraction of set theory.
	- All three theories above are related to what [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspondence) calls the [[Curry–Howard–Lambek correspondence]] which purports to show how <u>proofs, programs, and category-theoretic are isomorphisms of a sort, and which suggests a deeper interconnectedness between the three</u>.

- ## [[Chomsky]]-[[Foucault]] Debate on [[Power]] vs [[Justice]] (1971)
	- {{video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpVQ3l5P0A4}}
	- Chomsky
		- 1. Human nature – Anarcho-syndicalism
			- {{youtube-timestamp 7}} **creative work / free creation** as fundamental human nature #species-being #human-nature
			- {{youtube-timestamp 30}} a decent society should maximize the possibilities of this quality to be realized
			- {{youtube-timestamp 55}} the appropriate social organization: a federated, decentralized system of free associations incorporating economic and social institutions
		- 2. Destination of social transformation / revolution
			- {{youtube-timestamp 363}}
		- 3. Action!
			- {{youtube-timestamp 531}} the risk of inaction.
			- {{youtube-timestamp 580}} we have to be bold enough to speculate, create social theories based on partial knowledge / judgement while remaining very open to the strong possibility that we're very far off the mark.
		- 4. Absolute basis of [[justice]]
			- {{youtube-timestamp 633}} Fundamental human qualities in which the notion of justice is grounded
	- Foucault
		- 1. Critique of institutions
			- {{youtube-timestamp 112}} [...] I admit not being able to define, let alone to propose an ideal social model for the functioning  of our society [...]
			- {{youtube-timestamp 171}} the urgent task: to identify that political power also exercises itself through institutions seemingly unrelated to political power:
				- educational system, excludes the instruments of power of another social class
				- psychiatry, justice
			- {{youtube-timestamp 244}} Our task is to critique the workings of institutions, to unmask violence of the political in order to struggle agains them, and to avoid the reproduction of these political violence
		- 2. A refutation against human nature
			- {{youtube-timestamp 438}} risk defining this human nature in terms derivative of our current society and culture.
				- {{youtube-timestamp 466}} Mao distinguishes between a bourgeois human nature and a proletarian one
		- 3. The notion of [[justice]]
			- {{youtube-timestamp 606}} <u>The notion of justice itself functions within a class society as a claim made by the oppressed class and as a justification for the oppressive class.</u> #class
			- {{youtube-timestamp 694}} Along with the notion of human essence, the notion of goodness or justice, and all other notions and concepts are part of our class system #knowledge
			- As a result, we cannot put these notions forward to justify a fight that shall overthrow the very foundations of our society
