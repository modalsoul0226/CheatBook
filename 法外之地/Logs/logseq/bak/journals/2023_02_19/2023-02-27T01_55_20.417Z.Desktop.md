- ## Install Archlinux
  collapsed:: true
	- ### Preparation
	  collapsed:: true
		- #### Remove Existing Linux System
		  collapsed:: true
			- #### Determine types of each disk partition
				- On Windows, open command line:
					- ```powersell
					  C:\Users\...>diskpart
					  
					  DISKPART>select disk 1
					  DISKPART>select partition 5
					  DISKPART>detail partition
					  ```
					- The disk and partition id used above can be found using the default Disk Management application in Windows.
					- Refer to [GUID Partition Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table) to check the system to which the partition GUID corresponds.
				-
			- #### Remove boot entry
				- Reference - [How to remove Linux from Dual Boot in Windows 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCCRFxKU7r4)
				- On Windows, open command line with administrator permission:
					- ```powershell
					  bcdedit /enum firmware
					  ```
					- Get the `id` (e.g. `{some-random-id-string}`) of the boot entry that needs to be deleted.
				- To delete the entry, in the command line:
					- ```powershell
					  bcdedit /delete {some-random-id-string}
					  ```
				-
			- #### Remove disk partitions
				- Open disk management and delete corresponding disk partitions.
		-
		- #### Create Bootable USB
			- Download Archlinux ISO at https://archlinux.org/download/.
			- Download the [Rufus tool](https://rufus.ie/en/) for flushing the USB and creating bootable drive.
			- Open Rufus as an administrator:
				- Choose correct device and .iso file.
				- Choose `GPT` as partition scheme and `UEFI` as target system.
			-
		- #### Disable Secure Boot
			- Restart and go to BIOS using `F2`.
			- TODO ? Disable `Intel Rapid Storage Technology`
			- TODO Disable `Secure Boot`!!!

	- ### Install
	  collapsed:: true
		- Press `ESC` key to select boot device
		- Set live environment's font size:
			- ```bash
			  fonsetfont ter-132n
			  ```
			-
		- Connect to internet:
			- ```bash
			  iwctl
			  
			  # if got waiting for iwctl to start...
			  sudo systemctl start iwd
			  
			  # show available device
			  [iwd]> device list
			  
			  # connect to wifi
			  [iwd]> station <device> connect <wifi-id>
			  ```
			-
		- Set system clock:
			- ```bash
			  # set timezone
			  timedatectl list-timezones
			  timedatectl set-timezone America/Toronto
			  
			  timedatectl status
			  ```
			-
		- Disk partition:
			- Create partitions:
				- ```bash
				  # list block devices
				  lsblk
				  
				  # cfdisk /dev/sdb
				  cfdisk <block-device>
				  
				  # create a partition for EFI System (500MB) /dev/sdb3
				  # create a partition for SWAP (4GB) /dev/sdb4
				  # create a parition for / (259.6GB) /dev/sdb5
				  ```
			- Format partitions:
				- ```bash
				  # format EFI system
				  mkfs.fat -F 32 /dev/sdb3
				  
				  # format SWAP
				  mkswap /dev/sdb4
				  swapon /dev/sdb4
				  
				  # format FS
				  mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb5
				  ```
				-
		- Run the `archinstall` script:
			- Reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Sz2W6k3HkM
			- ```bash
			  archinstall
			  
			  # notes for disk partition:
			  # - assign mount-point for a partition:
			  # 	- set mount point for /boot
			  # 	- set mount point for /
			  
			  # install packages:
			  # git firefox kitty neovim htop neofetch
			  ```
			-
			- Issues:
				- `Failed to read disk "/dev/sdc" with lsblk`
					- Unplug the bootable usb in the `archiso` live environment.
				- When installing additional packages, got `The requested URL returned error: 404`
					- Skip the `additional packages` option during archinstall.
					- Or try again some time (maybe hours) later.
				- When the install finishes, got black screen and only `tty` is available.
					- Could be because the graphics card driver is not working, during the archinstall, choose `all open source (default)` to install drivers for both Nvidea dedicated gpu and Intel integrated gpu.
					- For configuraing **Hybrid Graphics Card**, refer to https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Hybrid_graphics.
