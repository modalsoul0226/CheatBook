- Xenakis' ideas and concepts, but also his sound aesthetics, are also utopian in a social sense: the noise musician Xenakis never limited himself to an academic new music audience, contacts and cooperation with DJs and noise musicians were dear to him, he also played his works on the beach or at world exhibitions. Utopia not only in the technical sense, but music also as a liberation and holistic experience of sound and space that overcomes social distinction.

- Using hyperbolic paraboloids, he composed Metastaseis for large orchestra (1956), whose impressive glissandi surfaces were to become one of his musical trademarks. He was also able to use said hyperbolic paraboloids in architecture: he used them to construct the famous pavilion for the 1958 World's Fair in Brussels

- He finally became a member of the Groupe de musique concrète (later called Groupe de recherches musicales, GRM) and electronic music became his way of playing new ideas and concepts.

- For Diamorphoses(1958), he built his own sound material by creating new textures from tiny particles of sound using crafty tape techniques.

- the Polytopes also enabled him to compose even more radical and sprawling music, which he also performed separately as sound works, such as the nearly hour-long works Persepolis (1970) and La Légende d'Eer (1978). He too developed a graphic interface for sound synthesis with his UPIC computer. Then, as computers became more available, he succeeded in implementing his so-called "stochastic synthesis," which underlies the pure noise music of his late electronic work (Gendy 3, S.709).

- The mutual influences of electronic music and instrumental music are conspicuous. In particular, the spatial conceptions, such as the arrangement of the musicians around the audience in his work for six percussionists,

- Persephassa (1968), which can already be called a classic, or the intermingling of a huge orchestra with the audience in Terretektorh (1969), are directly related to his electroacoustic spatialization concepts: immersive and overwhelming.

- Xenakis composed it for eight channels, although he did not yet have an 8-track machine at his disposal. He simply used four stereo tapes, from which the piece was played on eight speakers arranged around the audience, even though they could not be precisely synchronized

- The 1968 performance became the "greatest scandal of electroacoustic music" (Michel Chion) and led to the final breakup with Pierre Schaeffer and the GRM.

- he edited and filtered orchestral recordings for Hibiki Hana Ma in 1970 (Figure 4), and listening to Japanese Biwa music, which he then also used, was an "enlightenment" for him.

- In short, Xenakis spanned a musical-craft space that simply overwhelmed most of his contemporaries. Xenakis was popular; in May 1968, students were said to have chanted his name at demonstrations, and performances of Bohor with synchronized fireworks took place on the beach in La Rochelle.

- The most radical aspects of sound can be found in Xenakis' late work and its merciless reduction to harsh, almost ruthless sound synthesis.

- In 1988/89, for Taurhiphanie and Voyage absolu des Unari vers Andromède (Figure 8), he had still transferred graphic structures into sound with the help of his UPIC machine, but he finally dispensed with this completely as well and devoted himself to the concept of a composing machine.

- This machine designs everything independently and calculates the finished piece – the algorithm is the work (S.709, Gendy 3). And out comes current noise music.

- He was the first to individualize the orchestra, assigning each individual instrument of the orchestra its own voice in order to achieve maximum diversity and create complex mass effects with it. To control this new tonal diversity not polyphonically but by statistical means was also his invention.
