## Set

A *set* is a collection of things (called its members or elements), the collection being regarded as a single object. We write $t \in A$ to say that $t$ is a member of $A$, and we write $t \notin A$ to say that $t$ is not a member of $A$.

## 1.1 Principle of Extensionality

If two sets have exactly the same membersm then they are equal.

If $A$ and $B$ are sets such that for every object $t$,
$$
t \in A  \quad \text{iff} \quad t \in B
$$
then $A=B$

## Union and Intersection

The *union* of sets $A$ and $B$ is the set $A \cup B$ of all things that are members of $A$ or $B$ (or both).

Similarly, the *intersection* of $A$ and $B$ is the set $A \cap B$ of all things that are members of both $A$ and $B$.

Sets $A$ and $B$ are said to be *disjoint* when they have no common members, i.e. when $A \cup B = \emptyset$.
