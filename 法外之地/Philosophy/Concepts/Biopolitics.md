## Definition
In short, biopolitics can be understood as a political rationality which takes the administration of life and populations as its subject: ‘to ensure, sustain, and multiply life, to put this life in order’.

Biopower thus names the way in which biopolitics is put to work in society

<u>[A] power that exerts a **positive influence** on life, that endeavours to administer, optimize, and multiply it, subjecting it to precise controls and comprehensive regulations.</u>

## [[Dispositif]]
This **dispositif** of power works from beneath, from the ‘level of life’ itself, and, as Foucault earlier described it in <i>[[Society Must Be Defended]]</i>, ‘<u>[i]t was a type of power that presupposed a closely meshed grid of material coercions rather than the physical existence of a sovereign’.</u>

Importantly, biopower did not replace repressive and deductive functions of power, but worked together with such technologies of power.

[...] working to incite, reinforce, control, monitor, optimize, and organize the forces under it [...]

## Sovereign Power vs. Biopower
Sovereign juridical power was in fact only a power to ‘take life or let live’, whereas biopower constituted ‘a power to foster life or disallow it to the point of death’.

[t]his bio-power was without question an indispensable element in the development of capitalism’ which <u>made possible ‘the controlled insertion of bodies into the machinery of production and the adjustment of the phenomena of population to <strong>economic</strong> processes’</u>
