## Pietism

Immanuel Kant was born in KÃ¶nigsberg in 1724, the fourth of the nin children of a poor harness-maker [...] At that time, <u>pietism</u>, a reformist movement within the Lutheran Church, held powerful sway among the lower and middle classes in Germany, <u>consoling hardship with the idea of the sacredness of work, duty, and prayer;</u> its vision of the sovereignty of conscience was to exert a lasting influence on Kant's moral thinking.

## Shackles of Egoism

"In these he ceased to be merely a speculative philosophy and became, at the same time, <u>a spirited orator, sweeping the heart and emotions along with him, as well as satisfying the intelligence</u> [...] he lifted up our minds and emotinos from the shackles of self-seeking egoism to the exalted self-awareness of pure free-will, to sbsolute obedience to the laws of reason and to the exalted sense of our duty to others!"

<p class="label">Rousseau, whose engraved portrait was the only picture in Kant's possession.</p>

Kant was aware of the accusations that the intellect draws to itself. And it was to the subject of this engraving that he turned in self-justification, saying that he should have regarded himself as much more worthless than the common labourer had not Rousseau convinced him that the intellect could play its part in <u>restoring the rights of man</u>.
