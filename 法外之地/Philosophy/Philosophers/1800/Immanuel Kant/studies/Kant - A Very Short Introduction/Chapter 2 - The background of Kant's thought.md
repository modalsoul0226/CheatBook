## Probl√©matique

- The most important we find to be the problem of objective knowledge, as this had been posed by [[Descartes]].
	- The fact that I exist is an objective fact; it is a fact about the world and not just about someone's perception.
	- Whatever the world contains, it contains the thinking being who I am.

- Kant, similarly dissatisfied with Descartes's argument [...] felt that the certainty of self-knowledge had been wrongly described.
	- I can be immediately certain of my present mental states. <u>But I cannot be immediately certain of what I am, or of whether, indeed, there is an 'I' to whom these states belong.</u>
	- These further porpositions must be established by argument, and that argument is yet to be found.

- In the subjective sphere being and seeming collapse into each other. In the objective sphere they diverge. <u>The world is objective because it can be other than it seems to me.</u>

- [[Leibniz]] and [[David Hume]];
	- The first claimed that we could have objective knowledge of the world uncontaminated by the point of view of any observer.
	- The second calimed that we could have objective knowledge of nothing.

- These problems, concerning <u>causality</u> and <u>a priori knowledge</u>, were combined with the question of <u>objectivity</u> to form the peculiar subject matter of the first [[Critique of Pure Reason | Critique]].
