## Modes of Subjectification

- He still plays on the duality of the term ‘subject’, speaking now of the ‘modes of subjectification’, whereby <u>an ethical code enters individuals’ lives and constitutes their identity</u>.

- And his general structure of subjectification – derived from an archaeological analysis of ancient texts – is certainly open to power relations.

- This structure involves, as its basis, the acts that concern sexual behaviour (what the Greeks called ta aphrodisia – the ‘things of Aphrodite’ and what Foucault labels the ‘ethical substance’).

- It further involves the sense in which individuals are made subject to the ethical code. This, which Foucault calls the ‘mode of subjection’, might be a matter of anything from conforming to social conventions to carrying out a programme of self-fulfilment.

## Problemitization

- Problematizations formulate the fundamental issues and choices through which individuals confront their existence.

- The fact that my existence is problematized in a specific way is no doubt determined by the social power relations in which I am embedded.

- But, given this problematization, I am able to respond to the issues it raises in my own way, or, more precisely, in a way by which I will define what I, as a self, am in my historical context.

## Marginalization vs. Problemitization

- In the ancient context where he introduces the term, it is the lives of free Greek males that are problematized, not those of marginalized groups such as women and slaves. 

- <u>**Marginalization** corresponds to the strongest constraints that a society exercises on individuals.</u>

	- Even the marginalized are not entirely determined by a society’s power structures, since they are capable of engaging (and succeeding) in revolutionary movements against what dominates them.

	- But <u>they can define themselves only through their struggle with power.</u>

- **Problemitization**. The ‘mainstream’ members of a society, those who are not marginalized, are less constrained.

	- <u>The power network defines them in a preliminary way but allows for a significant range of further self-definition.</u>

	- Unlike the marginalized, they have available ‘niches’ within the society that provide them room for self-formation in their own terms. The ‘problematization’ of the free Greek male lies in this domain.

## Ancient vs. Christians

- According to Foucault, there are relatively few differences between the ancients and the Christians on the level of moral codes and conduct.

	- The ethical rules laid down and the actual patterns of behaviour these rules determine are, despite some striking exceptions such as same-sex relations, quite similar.

	- But fundamental differences arise when we look at the formation of ethical subjects.

- <u>The root of the differences, says Foucault, is the Christian claim that <span class="title">ta aphrodisia</span> are intrinsically evil and so primarily objects of ethical denial. For the ancients, by contrast, sex was a natural good.</u>
