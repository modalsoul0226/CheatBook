## Identity of the Author

-  To be an [[Authorship|author]] is not merely to have a certain factual relation to a text (for example, to have causally produced it); it is, rather, <u>to fulfil a certain socially and culturally defined role in relation to the text. <mark>Authorship is a [[Social Construction|social construction]]</mark>, not a natural kind, and it will vary over cultures and over time.</u>

-  Foucault further maintains that <u>the <mark>author function</mark>, as it operates in a given text, does not correspond to a single self (person) who is the author of that text.</u>

## Language as the Producer (of the Text)

> Who is Speaking

-  [[Nietzsche]], he said, showed us the importance of always asking of a text <mark>‘Who is speaking?’</mark> (<u>who – from what historical position, with what particular interests – is claiming the authority to be listened to?</u>). But, Foucault continues, [[Mallarmé]] responded to this question, at least as it concerns literature: 

> <span class="quote-en">**it is ‘the word itself’** </span>

<p class="close">
	(<span class="title">The Order of Things</span>, 305)
</p>

-  Are there, as Mallarmé suggests, senses in which a text is due to the word, to language itself, rather than to its author?

-  Accordingly, when authors write, <u>much of what they say is a product not of their distinctive insight or ability but the result of the language they are employing. For much of the text <mark>it is just language that is speaking.</mark></u>

---

> Conventional Authors

-  Authors can react to this fact in different ways. 

	1. One standard (romantic) idea sees the author as straining against the structures of language to express unique individual insights.

		- Here the assumption is that an author has access to a personal, prelinguistic vision, the expression of which must work against language’s tendency to merely conventional expression. 
		
	2. A contrary ‘classical’ idea sees the author as accepting and deploying the standard structures to craft yet another work embodying a traditional vision.

- <u>Both the classical and the romantic views present writing as a matter of individuals expressing themselves;</u> they differ only over whether what is expressed should be the author’s own personal vision or the author’s appropriation of a tradition.

## Death of the Author

> Let the Language Reveal itself

-  Foucault, however, is especially interested in another mode in which authors can relate to language, one in which the point is not to use language for self-expression but to <u>lose the self in language</u>.

-  This sort of authorship corresponds to a certain sense of literary modernism, associated with the <mark>‘death of the author’</mark> – although, as our discussion has shown, this is really just the death of the conception of the author as self-expressive. <u>Replacing it is the idea of an author as a vehicle for letting language reveal itself.</u>

> Inauguration at Collège de France

-  The notion is particularly prominent in Foucault’s inaugural address for his chair at the [[Collège de France]]. Here we see the strongly personal resonance of this theme for Foucault.

-  Foucault associates himself with the modernist voice of [[Samuel Beckett|Beckett]]’s Molloy:

> <span class="quote-en">I must go on; I can’t go on; I must go on; I must say words as long as there are words, I must say them until they find me, until they say me …</span>

<p class="close">
	(Samuel Beckett, <span class="title">The Unnameable</span>)
</p>


-  Later in the lecture, he argues that <u>the notion of the author as ‘the unifying principle in a group of writings or statement</u>, lying at the origins of their significance, as the seat of their coherence’ (<span class="title">The Discourse on Language</span>, 221) <u>is less a source of creative expression than a principle of limitation</u>, forcing us to read a text as conforming with a comprehensive authorial project.

-  It remains clear that, <u>for Foucault, language can and must take us beyond the mode of subjective or even inter-subjective expression.</u>

## Transgression, or the Truth Beyone the Subjective

-  But in what sense might language offer us <u>a truth beyond our subjective selves</u>?

-  Anglophone ordinary-language philosophy, following [[Wittgenstein]] in the 1950s and 1960s, offered one way of uncovering this <mark>linguistic ‘unconscious’</mark>. The [[Archaeology of Knowledge]] Foucault developed in the 1960s offered another, much more historical way.

-  Here his fascination is rather with <u>writing that puts extreme pressure on language, that presses it to its limits with paradox, and that, as a result, produces experiences of violation and <mark>[[Transgression|transgression]]</mark>.</u>

---

<br>

## Georges Bataille

> Limit-Experience

-  A premier example of such writing is that of [[Bataille|Georges Bataille]], about whom Foucault wrote his passionately obscure essay [[A Preface to Transgression]].

-  <mark>[[Sexuality]]</mark>, the primary theme of Bataille’s violently [[Eroticism|pornographic]] fiction, <mark>is a primary locus of transgression because it is implicated in all of our [[Limit-Experiences]]</mark> (Foucault’s term for experiences of transgression, those that take us to or beyond the limits of intelligibility and propriety).

-  <u>Pushing consciousness to its limits leads to the unconscious, which after [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] we all know is a maelstrom of sexual desires.</u> The limit of the laws of human societies is the universal taboo of incest. And <u>the limits of language</u>, specifying, in Foucault’s words,

> <span class="quote-en">just how far speech may advance upon the sands of silence</span>

<p class="close">
	(<span class="title">A Preface to Transgression</span>)
</p>

- <u>are, of course, always marked by the ‘forbidden words’ of sexuality.</u>

---

> Difference with Pornographic Writings

-  Pornographic writing is typically a very conservative medium, of course, a series of clichés, clogged with erotic associations that stimulate desire, but not offering new modes of experience or thought.

-  Bataille’s pornography, however, is less likely to arouse than to shock, repel, and dazzle through the extremity of its images, all the more disturbing because they are expressed in classically limpid prose.

---

> Limits of the Subjective

-  It is further intensified by the paradox implicit in the post-Nietzschean world Bataille inhabits. In this world, [[God is dead]], which means that <u>there are no objectively defined <mark>limits of thought or action</mark></u> against which we can hurl ourselves.

- <u> Our limits are ones that we know are set by ourselves, so passing beyond (transgressing) them can only mean rebelling against ourselves</u>, via

> <span class="quote-en">a profanation that is empty and turned inward upon itself, whose instruments are brought to bear on nothing but each other</span>

<p class="close">
	(<span class="title">A Preface to Transgression</span>)
</p>

-  But the very absurdity of this effort heightens the limit-experience through its defiance of the very laws of logic.

-  The point of this exercise in extremism is to release forces within language that will hurl us to the limits of our ordinary concepts and experiences and <u>give us a</u> (perhaps transforming) <u>glimpse of radically new modes of thought</u>.

-  His writing is designed to unleash from language new transgressive truths that will take him and his readers beyond the realm of their knowledge and capacity of expression.

## Maurice Blanchot

> The Complete Withdrawal of All Subjectivity

-  But Bataille’s pornographic violence is by no means the only way to make a space for language itself to speak.

-  Whereas his prose flows from an <u>excess of subjectivity</u>, from erotic fantasy incited to extraordinary limits, the writing of [[Maurice Blanchot]] shimmers with a strangeness that seems due to the <mark>complete withdrawal of all subjectivity</mark>. 

---

> Thought of the Outside

-  As Foucault reads him, Blanchot is a master of the <mark>‘thought of the outside’</mark>, a thought (or even an experience) that, embodies

> <span class="quote-en">the breakdown of philosophical subjectivity and its dispersion in a language that dispossesses it while multiplying it within the space created by its absence</span>

<p class="close">
	(<span class="title">A Preface to Transgression</span>)
</p>

-  Foucault traces this experience from [[Sade]] and [[Friedrich Hölderlin|Hölderlin]] through [[Nietzsche]] and [[Mallarmé]] to [[Artaud]], Bataille, and [[Klossowski]], to a culmination in Blanchot.

-  While his predecessors have expressed the thought of the outside by, in their various ways, <u>separating language from its roots in divine and human consciousness</u>, Blanchot is so completely absent from his texts that 'for us he is that thought itself – its real, absolutely distant, shimmering, invisible presence.'

-  <u>The central and controlling subject is replaced by language itself.</u>
	-  Not language as the instrument or expression of consciousness, but language ‘in its attentive and forgetful being, with its power of dissimulation that <u>effaces every determinate meaning and even the existence of the speaker</u>’.

## Pleasure

-  Foucault’s fascination with avant-garde literature is an aspect of his tendency to <u>seek, in extreme (limit-) experiences, a truth and fulfilment beyond that of ordinary existence</u>. As he said in an interview (just two years before his death):

> <span class="quote-en">those middle-range pleasures that make up everyday life… are nothing for me... <u>A pleasure must be something incredibly intense</u>… Some drugs are really important for me because they are the mediations to those incredibly intense joys that I’m looking for.</span>
