## Identity of the Author

-  To be an [[Authorship|author]] is not merely to have a certain factual relation to a text (for example, to have causally produced it); it is, rather, <u>to fulfil a certain socially and culturally defined role in relation to the text. <mark>Authorship is a [[Social Construction|social construction]]</mark>, not a natural kind, and it will vary over cultures and over time.</u>

-  Foucault further maintains that <u>the <mark>author function</mark>, as it operates in a given text, does not correspond to a single self (person) who is the author of that text.</u>

## Language as the Producer (of the Text)

-  [[Nietzsche]], he said, showed us the importance of always asking of a text <mark>‘Who is speaking?’</mark> (<u>who – from what historical position, with what particular interests – is claiming the authority to be listened to?</u>). But, Foucault continues, [[Mallarmé]] responded to this question, at least as it concerns literature: 

> <span class="quote-en">**it is ‘the word itself’** </span>

<p class="close">
	(<span class="title">The Order of Things</span>, 305)
</p>

-  Are there, as Mallarmé suggests, senses in which a text is due to the word, to language itself, rather than to its author?

-  Accordingly, when authors write, <u>much of what they say is a product not of their distinctive insight or ability but the result of the language they are employing. For much of the text <mark>it is just language that is speaking.</mark></u>

-  Authors can react to this fact in different ways. 

	1. One standard (romantic) idea sees the author as straining against the structures of language to express unique individual insights.

		- Here the assumption is that an author has access to a personal, prelinguistic vision, the expression of which must work against language’s tendency to merely conventional expression. 
		
	2. A contrary ‘classical’ idea sees the author as accepting and deploying the standard structures to craft yet another work embodying a traditional vision.

- <u>Both the classical and the romantic views present writing as a matter of individuals expressing themselves;</u> they differ only over whether what is expressed should be the author’s own personal vision or the author’s appropriation of a tradition.

## Death of the Author

-  Foucault, however, is especially interested in another mode in which authors can relate to language, one in which the point is not to use language for self-expression but to <u>lose the self in language</u>.

-  This sort of authorship corresponds to a certain sense of literary modernism, associated with the <mark>‘death of the author’</mark> – although, as our discussion has shown, this is really just the death of the conception of the author as self-expressive. <u>Replacing it is the idea of an author as a vehicle for letting language reveal itself.</u>

> Inauguration at Collège de France

-  The notion is particularly prominent in Foucault’s inaugural address for his chair at the [[Collège de France]]. Here we see the strongly personal resonance of this theme for Foucault.

-  Foucault associates himself with the modernist voice of [[Samuel Beckett|Beckett]]’s Molloy:

> <span class="quote-en">I must go on; I can’t go on; I must go on; I must say words as long as there are words, I must say them until they find me, until they say me …</span>

<p class="close">
	(Samuel Beckett, <span class="title">The Unnameable</span>)
</p>


-  Later in the lecture, he argues that <u>the notion of the author as ‘the unifying principle in a group of writings or statement</u>, lying at the origins of their significance, as the seat of their coherence’ (<span class="title">The Discourse on Language</span>, 221) <u>is less a source of creative expression than a principle of limitation</u>, forcing us to read a text as conforming with a comprehensive authorial project.

-  It remains clear that, <u>for Foucault, language can and must take us beyond the mode of subjective or even inter-subjective expression.</u>

## Transgression, or the Truth Beyone the Subjective

-  But in what sense might language offer us <u>a truth beyond our subjective selves</u>?

-  Anglophone ordinary-language philosophy, following [[Wittgenstein]] in the 1950s and 1960s, offered one way of uncovering this <mark>linguistic ‘unconscious’</mark>. The [[Archaeology of Knowledge]] Foucault developed in the 1960s offered another, much more historical way.

-  Here his fascination is rather with <u>writing that puts extreme pressure on language, that presses it to its limits with paradox, and that, as a result, produces experiences of violation and [[Transgression|transgression]]</u>

## Georges Bataille

-  A premier example of such writing is that of [[Bataille|Georges Bataille]], about whom Foucault wrote his passionately obscure essay [[A Preface to Transgression]].

-  <u>[[Sexuality]]</u>, the primary theme of Bataille’s violently [[Eroticism|pornographic]] fiction, <u>is a primary locus of transgression because it is implicated in all of our [[Limit-Experiences]]</u> (Foucault’s term for experiences of transgression, those that take us to or beyond the limits of intelligibility and propriety).

-  <u>Pushing consciousness to its limits leads to the unconscious, which after [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] we all know is a maelstrom of sexual desires.</u> The limit of the laws of human societies is the universal taboo of incest. And <u>the limits of language</u>, specifying, in Foucault’s words,

> <span class="quote-en">just how far speech may advance upon the sands of silence</span>

<p class="close">
	(<span class="title">A Preface to Transgression</span>)
</p>

- <u>are, of course, always marked by the ‘forbidden words’ of sexuality.</u>
