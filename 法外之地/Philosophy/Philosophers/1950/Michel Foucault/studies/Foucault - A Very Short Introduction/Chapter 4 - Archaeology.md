## Archaeology of Thought

-  Foucault’s idea of an archaeology of thought is closely linked to the modernist literary idea that <u>language is a source of thought in its own right, not merely an instrument for expressing the ideas of those who use it</u>.

-  <u>At any given period in a given domain, there are <mark>substantial constraints</mark> on how people are able to think.</u>

## Marginalization of the Subject

> [[Marginalization]]

- <u> The ‘<mark>history of ideas</mark>’</u> – where this means what is consciously going on in the minds of scientists, philosophers, et al. – <u>is less important than the <mark>underlying structures</mark> that form the context for their thinking.</u>

-  It is not that he denies the reality or even the supreme ethical importance of the individual consciousness. But he thinks that individuals operate in a conceptual environment that determines and limits them in ways of which they cannot be aware.

## The Geology and Psychoanalysis Analogy

-  Foucault himself employs it when he speaks of the ‘<mark>sedimentary strata</mark>’ (<span class="title">Archaeology of Knowledge</span>) uncovered by the kind of historical approach he proposes.

-  The psychoanalytic metaphor, which Foucault himself emphasizes, rightly presents the underlying structures as part of an unconscious and as discovered only through analysis of linguistic events of which we are aware. But, unlike psychoanalysis, Foucault’s history is not hermeneutic.

-  Archaeologists of knowledge, in other words, do not ask what Descartes’ Meditations mean (that is, what ideas Descartes was trying to express in them). Rather, <u>they use what Descartes</u> – and many other writers, famous or not, of the same period – <u>wrote as clues to the general structure of the system in which they thought and wrote. The interest</u>, to invoke the archaeological analogy once more, <u>is not in the particular object (text) studied but in the overall configuration of the site from which it was excavated.</u>

## Distortions of the Subject-Centered History

-  Foucault does not exclude such ‘subject-centred’ accounts, but he points out that they are prone to characteristic distortions.

-  They treat history as a story, a narrative, which, since it is told from the standpoint of one or more person’s experiences, assumes the continuity and goal-directedness of consciousness.

- <u>History thus becomes a novel, with a plot unified by the concerns of human beings and leading to a humanly meaningful conclusion.</u>

-  Such narration has a superficial validity due to the false assumption that human history is primarily driven by the experiences and projects of the consciousnesses that live it. <u>Archaeology introduces factors outside consciousness that may belie the continuity and direction that we read into our lives.</u>

## Kant

- Foucault is not concerned with formal (syntactic or semantic) structures but those that constrain the material content of what is said and thought.

- This notion of ‘constraining’ thought suggests one final disciplinary analogy for the archaeology of thought: <u>the effort</u>, characteristic of so much philosophy since [[Kant]], <u>to determine the ‘<mark>conditions of possibility</mark>’ of our concepts and experience.</u>

---

> The Transcendental Conditions of Possibility

-  Kant called these conditions ‘transcendental’ because they are neither empirical (that is, due to the contingent history of human life) nor transcendent (that is, due to necessary constraints imposed on us from outside).

-  Rather, they are conditions necessary, given our situation as finite knowers, for our being able to have any experience at all of a world.

	-  On Kant’s view, the transcendental conditions on the possibility of experience require, for example, that we experience objects as existing in space and time and as substances subject to causal laws. Since such conditions are prior to experience, Kant called them ‘a priori’ (as opposed to the ‘a posteriori’ truths that are derived from our experience).

---

> The Contingent Conditions of Possibility

- Foucault sometimes characterized his archaeological project in Kantian language, saying that it sought the ‘conditions of possibility’ for thought in a given period (OT, xxii).

- <u>For Kant, however, such conditions were universally applicable, necessary constraints on all possible experiences, whereas for Foucault they are contingent on the particular historical situation and vary over times and domains of knowledge.</u>

- Foucault says that <u>archaeology leads to only <mark>relativized ‘historical a prioris’</mark>, not the atemporal, absolute a priori truths that Kant claimed to have discovered.</u>
