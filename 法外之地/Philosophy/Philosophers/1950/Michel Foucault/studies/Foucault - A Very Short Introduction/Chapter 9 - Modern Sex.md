## Repressive Hypothesis

- This is <u>the common assumption that the primary attitude of modern society toward sex</u> (beginning in the 18th century, reaching a peak in the Victorian Age, and still exerting strong influence today) <u>was negative</u>; that, except for the closely delimited sphere of monogamous marriage, sexuality was opposed, silenced, and, as far as possible, eliminated.

## Inventive Discourse

- But he denies that modern power is primarily exercised through repression and that opposition to repression is an effective way of resisting modern power.

- Rather, he thinks that <u>modern power created new forms of sexuality by inventing discourses about it.</u> For example, although same-sex relations have occurred throughout human history, <u>the homosexual as a distinct category</u>, with defining psychological, physiological, and perhaps even genetic characteristics, <u>was created by <mark>the [[Power/Knowledge|power/knowledge]] system</mark> of the modern sciences of sexuality.</u>

## Hermeneutics of the Self

- … All these factors were needed for the confessor to determine the degree of guilt (for example, mortal versus venial sin), impose an appropriate penance, and give advice for moral improvement.

- The result for penitents was <u>an ever deeper and more precise <mark>self-knowledge</mark>, the outcome of a ‘hermeneutics of the self ’ that revealed as fully as possible their inner sexual natures</u>.

- Foucault’s suggestion, however, is that <u>this nature is not so much discovered as <mark>constituted by the required self-examination</mark>. What I am sexually depends on the categories I am required to use in making my confession.</u>

## Social Construct

- <u>A large part of the history of modern sexuality is the secular adaptation and expansion of these religious techniques of <mark>self-knowledge</mark>.</u>

	- Confession may no longer be made to a priest but it is surely made to one’s doctor, psychiatrist, best friend, or, at least, to oneself.

- The categories that define the possibilities of one’s sexual nature are not self-chosen but accepted on the authority of ‘experts’ in the new modern sciences of sexuality.

	- Such experts present as discoveries about human nature what are actually just <u>new social norms for behaviour</u>.

 - Of course, there is a distinction between sexuality as a [[Social Construction|social construct]] and sex as a biological reality.

	- Foucault does not deny that there are, for example, undeniable physiological facts about human reproduction.

	- But he maintains that <u>once we move from sheer biology to the inevitably <mark>hermeneutic and normative concepts</mark> of psychology, anthropology, etc., the distinction breaks down.</u>

## Categories

- Just as the modern sciences of criminology define <u>categories of social dysfunction</u> (juvenile delinquent, kleptomaniac, drug addict, serial killer, etc.) that are simultaneously sources of knowledge and of control regarding their ‘subjects’.

- So the modern sciences of sexuality define<u>categories of sexual dysfunction</u> (homosexual, nymphomaniac, fetishist, etc.) that have a parallel role as <mark>power/knowledge</mark>.

- Many of us today will be shocked at Foucault’s insouciance over what we might well judge sexual molestation, but Foucault would no doubt see our reaction as itself a sign of the effects of the modern power/knowledge system.

## Biopower

- In the concluding chapter of the introduction to The History of Sexuality, Foucault seems to be moving beyond sexuality as such and develops a notion of [[Biopower|biopower]].

- <u>Biopower embraces all the forms of modern power directed toward us as living beings, that is, as subject to standards of not just sexual but <mark>biological normality</mark>.</u>

- Biopower is concerned with the ‘<u>task of administering life</u>’, a process that operates on two levels.

	1. On the level of individuals, there is an ‘anatomo-politics of the human body’;

	2. On the level of social groups, there is a ‘bio-politics of populations’ (<span class="title">History of Sexuality</span>, 139).

- The first level implicitly complements the primarily epistemological treatment of medicine in <span class="title">The Birth of the Clinic</span>, making explicit <u>the political significance</u> (in a broad sense that includes the social and the economic) <u>of the medical norms defining a healthy individual</u>.

	- So, for example, the modern medical notion of obesity corresponds to the marginalized social class of ‘fat people’;

	- and modern techniques of drug treatments of illness are inextricably tied to the economics of the pharmaceutical industry.

- The second level concerns <u>the modern focus on a nation’s entire population as a resource that must be protected, supervised, and improved</u>.

	- Thus, capitalism requires universal medical care and education to ensure an adequate workforce;

	- racist ideologies call for eugenic measures to protect the purity of the population ‘stock’;

	- and military planners develop the concept of ‘total war’, as a battle between not just armies but entire populations.

## History of the Subject

- This had already begun to emerge in <span class="title">Discipline and Punish</span>, where Foucault occasionally noted how the objects of disciplinary control could themselves <u>internalize the norms whereby they were controlled and so become monitors of their own behaviour</u>.

- In the context of sexuality, this phenomenon becomes central, since individuals are supposed to discern their own fundamental nature as sexual beings and, on the basis of this self-knowledge, transform their lives.

- As a result, <u>we are controlled not only as objects of disciplines that have expert knowledge of us; we are also controlled as <mark>self-scrutinizing and self-forming subjects</mark> of our own knowledge.</u>
