## Chronology

| Year (BCE)|   Event   |  Description  |
|----------|:-------------:|:------:|
|424|**Birth of Plato**, son of Ariston|The usual date given for Plato's birth is 428 or 427.|
|404|**The defeat of Athens in the [[Peloponnesian War]]**|The defeat against Sparta signals the temporary end of the democracy which had governed Athens for most of the previous hundred years. It is replaced by a junta of ligarchs, at least two of whom are members of Plato's immediately family. [[The Thirty Tyrants]], as they become known, last only a few months before being overthrown in a civil war and replaced by a revived democracy.|
|399|**The Trial of Socrates**|Under the new democratic government, Socrates - Plato's mentor and friend for up to ten years previously - is brought to trial on charges brought by private prosecutors. <u>The charges are introducing new divinities in their place; also of corrupting the young.</u> Socrates' condemnation and subsequent execution by hemlock poisoning are the last straw. Plato more or less withdraws from the world of practical politics.|
|390|Begin to publish|Plato may have spent some time out of Athens, travelling both in Greece and around the eastern Mediterranean. Meanwhile, he is beginning to publish.|
|390s-380s|Composes a large and varies group of works|In alphabetical order as follows: [[Apology]], [[Charmides]], [[Cratylus]], [[Crito]], [[Euthydemus]], [[Euthyphro]], [[Gorgias]], [[Hippias Minor]], [[Ion]], [[Laches]], [[Lysis]], [[Menexenus]], [[Meno]], [[Phaedo]], [[Protagoras]], [[Symposium]]. The relative dating of the items in this group is controversial, though it may be that [[Cratylus]], [[Phaedo]] and [[Symposium]] were among the last written.|
|389-388|Visits [[Pythagoreans]]|Plato visits Sicily and southern Italy and establishes contact with Pythagoreans in the area.|
|387|**Founds the Academy**|Plato founds the [[Academy]], an institution for research and teaching, adjacent to one of the main gymnasia of Athens, sacred to the local hero Academus.|
|380s-370s|Composes the second group of dialogues.|[[Parmenides]], [[Phaedrus]], [[Republic]], [[Theaetetus]]|
|367|Second visit to Sicily|Second visit to Sicily at the invitation of Dion, uncle of Dionysius II, tyrant or dictator of Syracuse. Some have supposed that Plato had hopes of making Dionysius an ideal ruler, a philosopher-king; if so, they were soon dashed. Plato evidently had some difficulty getting home.|
|365|**Aristotle**|Arrival in the [[Academy]] of its most eminent member, [[Aristotle]].|
|361|Third visit to Sicily|Plato visits Sicily once more, for unknown reasons; in any caes this visit too seems to have ended badly.|
|360s-350s|Third group of dialogues|[[Philebus]], [[Sophist]], [[Statesman]], [[Timaeus-Critias]], [[Laws]] (known to have been Ploto's last work; he may stil have been working on it when he died.)|
|347|**Plato dies**||
