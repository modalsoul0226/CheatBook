# Outline of the Argument of the Republic

## [[Social Darwenism]]

- Thrasymachus offers, and then explains, his own rival account of justice, in terms of 'what is in the interets of the stronger', i.e., those who hold political power.
- Socrates examines and dismantles Thrasymachus' account of justice, which turns out to include the claim that the person with the greatest power, the dictator or tyrant, and so the greatest opportunity for injustice, is also the happiest.

## 城邦作为个体的隐喻

- Accepting the challenge, <u>Socrates proposes to examine the nature of justice by establishing first what it, and the other sorts of goodness or virtue, might look like in the case of a good city, and then transferring the results to the individual</u>  – it must somehow be the same thing in both cases, only easier to see in the city, because on a larger scale.

## 城邦森严的等级制度

- A first, and basic, city emerges, consisting of pooling his labour and products.
- A doundation myth will be invented, according to which these select few have been born - from the very soil of their land – with **gold** in their soulds; the ordinary guards have **silver**, the ordinary population, the producers and the rest, **iron and bronze**.

## 城邦的美德

- So the city if founded. The assumpotion is that it is a good one, and if so, it will contain the different kinds of goodness of excellence: <u>wisdom, courage, moderation and justice.</u>
- Its **widsom** will reside in the knowledge about government possessed by the rulers, its **courage** in the ability of the soldier-guards to preserve the beliefs ingrained in them about what is and is not to be feared, its **moderation** in the way the desires of the majority are, by agreement, under the control of the wisdmo of the rulers;

> [[Organs]]

- As for **justice**, Socrates argues that the city will be just by virtue of its adherence ot a principle that underlay the whole construciton of the city – namely, that <u>each and every individual should be restricted to the single function to which he is best suited.</u>

## 个人的美德

- Now that justice in the city has turned out to be a matter of the relationship between three different kinds or classes, can justice in the individual be understood in the same sort of way?
- <u>The soul consists respectively of a rational element, a 'spirited' element, and an appetitive one</u>...
- Thus justice in the individual turns out to consist in the performance by each of the three elements in the soul, namely, the reasoning element, the spirited and the appetitive, of the **single role appropriate to each**: <u>a soul, and a person, will be just if reason rules, if spirit does what spirit properly does and if the appetites perform their proper functions</u> [...] In short, justice turns out to be 'a sort of health of the soul'.

## 废除家庭

> [[femminism]]?

- Socrates proposes, first, that it would be both perfectly natural, and actually the best thing, for females to share all functions in the city, and therefore also the same education, as the males; second, that it is similarly both possible and best that the nuclear family be abolished, that the women be held by the men – and by implication, the men by the women – in common, and that the children be held in common too.

## 哲人王的条件

- ... the philosopher, who recognizes that beauty is something that can and must be understood in and by itself. It's the philosopher, he argues, who has the greatest claim to knowledge...
- They'll be addicted to knowing about things, i.e., things as they really are, so they'll be by nature less interested in ordinary pleasures – and so , nmaturally moderatel they won't worry about things ordinary people worry about, so they'll be naturally courageous, too, and just, and they'll also be quick at learning, have a good memory, be graceful...

## [[Image]]

- What is the good? Socrates finally consents to give an idea of his thinking on the subject – in the form of **three images**: <u>one comparing the good to the sun; one representing different states of mind, from mere conjecture through to knowledge, in terms of sections of a line (the divided line image); and one picturing the ascent from ordinary perceptions and assumptions to the knowledge needed for ruling, as **a journey from darkness to light**.</u>

## [[Allegory of the Cave|洞穴寓言]]

- A prisoner is imagined being led up and out of a dark underground cave, where he and his fellow-prisoners could see only shadows, to the sunlit world above, and then going back down again to join the others (the cave image).
- So too will the newly trained philosophers, each in his or her turn, go back down from enjoying the pleasures of philosophy to take charge of the good city;
- By constrast, the freed prisoner of the image is merely laughed at when he goes back (as Socrates was, in Athens, especially in the theatre) - but then, in the cave, nothing has changed, whereas in the good city everything will, or would, be different.

---

## [[Desire]] – [[Reason]]

- Socrates now describes the true awfulness of the claim – injustice is preferable to justice: it is like recommending us to bring up and feed <u>a many-headed monster – representing the bodily desires and pleasures</u> – within our very selves.

---

## [[Mimesis]]

- Poetry [...] works through 'imitation' [...] rather than through narration. Such imitation has a corroding effect on us, because <u>it focuses our minds on the appearance of things rather than their **reality**.</u>
