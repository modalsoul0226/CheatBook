# Beginning with Ordinary Things

## Social and Sensory Terms of Language
- Physical things generally, however remote, become known to us only through the effects which they help to induce at our sensory surfaces.

- Yet our common sense talk of physical things goes forward without benefit of explanations in more intimately sensory terms.

	- <u>Each of us learns his language form other people, through the observable mouthing of words under conspicuously intersubjective circumstances.</u>

	- Talk of subjective sense qualities comes mainly as a derivative idiom.
		- <u>When one tries to describe a particular sensory quality, he typically resorts to reference to public things.</u>

## Empiricism and Its Refutations

- Impressed with the fact that we know external things only mediately through our senses, philosophers from Berkeley onward have undertaken to strip away the physicalistic conjectures and bare the sense data.

- Yet even as we try to recapture the data, in all their innocence of interpretation, we find ourselves depending upon sidelong glances into natural science.

- Our philosopher may try to abstract out a pure stream of sense experience and then depict phytsical doctrine as a means of systematizing the regularities discernible in the stream.

- He may imagine an ideal "protocol language" which is evidently prior.

- But this is a misleading way of depicting matters. For the trouble is that <u>immediate experience simply will not, of itself, cohere as an autonomous domain. References to physical things are largely what hold it together.</u>
	- They give us our main continuing access to past sense data themselves, as a memory trace of a sense datum is too meager an affair to do much good.
	- <u>Actual memories mostly are traces not of past sensations but of past conceptualizatino and verbalization.</u>

- The mistake composes only in seeking an implicit sub-basement of conceptualization, or of language. <u>Conceptualization on any considerable scale is inseparable from language, and our ordinary language of physical things is about as basic as language gets.</u>

## Neurath's Boat Analogy

- ==Neurath has linkened science to a boat which, if we are to rebuild it, we must rebuild plank by plank while staying afloat in it.==

- The philosopher and the scientist are in the same boat.

	- If we improve our understanding of ordinary talk of physical things, it will not be by reducing that talk to a more familiar idiom; there is none.

	- It will be by clarifying the connections, causal, or otherwise, between ordinary talk of physical things and various further matters which in turn we grasp with help of ordinary talk of physical things.

#### The Johnsonian Usage

- It was a lexicographer, <u>Dr. Johnson, who demonstrated the reality of a stone by kicking it</u>; and to begin with, at least, we have little better to go on than Johnsonian usage since our questioning of objects can coherently begin only in relation to a system of theory which is itself predicated on our interim acceptances of objects.

	- <u>No inquiry being possible without some conceptual scheme</u>, we may as well retain and use the best one we know.

- Our boat stays afloat because at each alteration we keep the bulk of it intact as a going concern [...] To vary Neurath's figure with Wittgensterin's, we may kick away our ladder only after we have climbed it.

## Conceptual Sovereignty

- <u>Analyze theory-building how we will, we all must start in the middle.</u> Our conceptual firsts are middle-sized, middle-distanced objects, and our introduction to them and to everything comes midway in the cultural evolution of the race.

- We cannot strip away the conceptual trappings sentence by sentence and leave a description of the objective world; but we can investigate the world, and man as apart of it, and thus find out what cues he could have of what goes on around him.

- Subtracting his cues from his world view, we get man's net contribution as the **difference**. This difference marks the extent of man's conceptual sovereignty.
