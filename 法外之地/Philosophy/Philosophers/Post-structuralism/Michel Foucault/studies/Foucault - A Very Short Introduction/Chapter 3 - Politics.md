> <span class="quote-en">I think I have in fact been situated in most of the squares of the political checkerboard, one after another and sometimes simultaneously: <u>as an [[Anarchism|anarchist]], [[Left-wing Politics|leftist]], ostentatious or disguised [[Marxism|Marxist]], technocrat in the service of Gaullism, new liberal, and so forth</u>… None of these descriptions is important by itself; taken together, on the other hand, they mean something. And I must admit that I rather like what they mean.</span>

## The Aesthetic and the Political

-  Although Foucault was away in Tunisia during the student revolts of [[May 68|May 1968]], Maurice Blanchot reports having seen and spoken to him at a demonstration at this time. If so, this was the only encounter between Foucault and the man he said he once ‘dreamt of being’.

- This story works nicely as <u>a symbol of the tension between the aesthetic and the political in Foucault’s life and thought</u>. Perhaps <u>he met his literary hero only at the very point at which he began to move away from high art</u> as our saving liberation <u>to an acceptance of the mundane political sphere</u> as the inevitable battleground for human freedom.

## Jean-Paul Sarte

- Abstruse philosophical or sociological treatises are denounced or praised because of their perceived <span class="title">prises de position</span> on political issues of the day.

- This attitude is especially apparent in [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]’s insistence that <mark>writing must be committed</mark> (<span class="title">engagée</span>).

	- <u><span class="title">La littérature engagée</span> is, for Sartre, <mark>writing that recognizes its inevitable relation to its historical situation</mark> and strives to make its readers aware of and act on the potential for human liberation implicit in that situation.</u>

	- Such writing is not, Sartre maintains, mere propaganda because it is not the servant of any specific ideology but expresses the ‘<u>eternal values implicit in social and political debates</u>’.

## The Universal and Specific Intellectual

-  Coming to maturity in the political instability and ambiguity of post-war France, Foucault was sceptical of Sartre’s <u>ethical and political absolutes</u> and questioned the pretensions of what he came to call, with Sartre clearly in mind, the ‘<mark>universal intellectual</mark>’, <u>a free spirit, ‘the spokesman of the universal’, ‘speaking in the capacity of master of truth and justice’</u> (‘<span class="title">Truth and Power</span>’).

-  This was no doubt once a worthy calling, but <u>today</u>, according to Foucault, <u>universal systems of morality no longer provide effective responses to social and political problems</u>.

-  <u>We need detailed responses formulated by those concretely involved in the problems.</u> This, Foucault maintains, is the domain of the ‘<mark>specific intellectual</mark>’, for example the teacher, engineer, doctor, or consultant who ‘has at his disposal, whether in the service of the State or against it, powers which can benefit or irrevocably destroy life’ – not Sartre but Oppenheimer.

## The Critical Intellectual

-  Call him rather – though he himself does not use the term – a ‘critical intellectual’, <u>someone who does not speak with the authority of universal principles or of specific social or political responsibilities but simply on the basis of his historical erudition and analytical skills</u>.

-  Neither ‘the rhapsodist of the eternal’ nor ‘the strategist of life and death’ (EW III, 129), <u>the critical intellectual provides the intellectual tools – awarenesses of strategic and [[Tactics|tactical]] possibilities – those in the political trenches need to fight their battles.</u>

## Polemics

- <u>Polemics comes to political issues with a general doctrinal framework it accepts as the only adequate basis for discussion.</u>

	- <u>Anyone who does not accept the framework is treated as an enemy who must be refuted</u>, not as a partner in the search for a solution.

	- Like parallel enterprises in religion (the eradication of heresy) and the judiciary (criminal prosecution), polemics ‘defines alliances, recruits partisans, unites interests or opinions, represents a party; it establishes the other as an enemy, an upholder of opposed interests against which one must fight until the moment this enemy is defeated’ (EW I, 112).

- Foucault rejects polemics as ‘<mark>sterilizing</mark>’.

	- ‘Has anyone ever seen a new idea come out of a polemic?’

	- Moreover, ‘it is really dangerous to make anyone believe that he can gain access to truth by such paths and thus to validate, even if merely in a symbolic form, the real political practices that could be warranted by it’.

- Ordinarily, Foucault says, <u>the worst consequences of the polemical attitude ‘remain suspended’, presumably because there is no decisive victor among the warring viewpoints.</u>

	- But, he says, we know what happens when one side is able to triumph: ‘one has only to look at what happened during the debates in the USSR over linguistics or genetics not long ago’ (EW I, 113).

## Problematization

-  Problematization does not ignore the doctrinal frameworks of polemical disputes – which are after all a primary source for our thinking about political questions.

-  But <u>it begins with questions that arise not necessarily from the frameworks themselves but from our ‘<mark>lived experiences</mark>’ in society.</u>

	-  Political discussions <u>should be driven by the concrete problems</u> that raise our questions, <u>not by the established theories</u> that claim to be able to answer them.

## Revolt

-  The basic act of revolt:

	-  Tthe impulse by which a single individual, a group, a minority, or an entire people says, ‘I will no longer obey,’ and <u>throws the risk of their life in the face of an authority they consider unjust</u>’ (<span class="title">Useless to Revolt?</span>).

	-  <u>Such an act</u>, he says, <u>is ‘irreducible’ and even an ‘escape’ from ‘history, and its long chains of reasons’.</u>

	-  The decision ‘to prefer the risk of death to the certainty of having to obey’ is the ‘last anchor point’ for any assertions of rights, ‘one more solid and closer to experience than [[Natural Rights|natural rights]]’ (<span class="title">Useless to Revolt?</span>).
