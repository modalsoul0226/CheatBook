## Rejection of Grand Narratives
	
- <u>Changes in thought are not themselves the products of thought.</u>
	
	- This corresponds to Foucault’s earlier rejection of the ‘[[Spirit|spirit]] of the time’ and similar quasi-[[Hegel|Hegelian]] modes of historical explanation, such as a [[Collective Unconscious|collective unconscious]].

	- But neither was Foucault happy with historians’ standard material modes of explanation in terms of technological or social influences. These are typically vague and general causes – the invention of printing, the rise of the bourgeoisie – that have explanatory force only to the extent that we see history as moving towards correspondingly vague and general goals, such as democracy and secularism.

- Foucault was <u>sceptical of grand teleological narratives focused on such goals and proposed instead accounts based on <mark>many specific ‘little’ causes</mark>, operating independently of one another, with no overall outcome in view.</u>

	- To cite an example from Foucault himself, in Discipline and Punish he shows how, among many other things, the invention of a new kind of rifle, more efficient ways of organizing the space of hospitals, and changes in the methods of teaching children penmanship all unwittingly contributed to the formation of a radically new system of social control.

## Social Control and Bodies

-  <u>The objects of these diverse and specific causes are human bodies.</u>

- The forces that drive our history do not so much operate on our thoughts, our social institutions, or even our environment as on our individual bodies.

- <u>A Foucaultian genealogy, then, is <mark>a historical causal explanation that is material, multiple, and corporeal</mark>.</u>

## Nietzsche

- [[Nietzsche]] (like Foucault himself) offers many programmatic remarks on genealogy – not all mutually consistent – among which can be found passages that match the main elements of Foucault’s practice.

	- For example, Nietzsche speaks of genealogy in terms of tracing <u>the Hernuft</u> (stock or descent) <u>of an idea or practice</u>, which connects with Foucault’s emphasis on the body.

	- Similarly, Nietzsche presents genealogy as naturalistic rather than idealistic and talks of <u>explaining morality</u>, in particular, <u>as a contingent phenomenon that developed from small ‘accidental’ causes.</u>

- In fact, however, Nietzsche’s most worked-out genealogy (<span class="title">The Genealogy of Morality</span>) is very different from the project Foucault undertakes in <span class="title">Discipline and Punish</span>.

	- For one thing, Nietzsche’s effort has nothing of the careful scholarship and documentary detail of Foucault’s book. It is not the product of serious archival research – ‘gray, meticulous, and patiently documentary’ (<span class="title">Nietzsche, Genealogy, History</span>) – but of an erudite amateur’s armchair speculations.

	- More significantly, Nietzsche’s genealogy operates with psychological causes (the pride and ambition of the strong, the resentment of the weak, the malicious ingenuity of priests), which have little to do with Foucault’s history of the body. Foucault offers no parallels to Nietzsche’s deployment of Socratic weakness and Pauline rancour as key genealogical causes.

- Nonetheless, <u>Foucault is thoroughly Nietzschean in one fundamental respect: <mark>the critical intent</mark> with which he employs his genealogy.</u>

	- Nietzsche used genealogy to show that our most revered institutions and practices were ‘human, all-too-human’.

	- Foucault’s genealogies likewise deconstruct, by showing their real origin, official meanings and evaluations involved in a society’s self-understanding.

## The Value-Orientation of Genealogy

- Foucault sums up the value-orientation of genealogy by saying that it is a ‘<mark>history of the present</mark>’. This is so in two senses.

	- First, the subject matter of the history is the origins of present rules, practices or institutions that claim an authority over us.

	- Second, <u>the primary intent is</u> not to understand the past in its own terms or for its own sake, but <u>to understand and evaluate the present, particularly with a view to discrediting unjustified claims of authority.</u>

## Power, Knowledge

- There is another crucial area where Foucault’s genealogy obviously evokes Nietzsche: in its claim that <u>there is an intimate tie between knowledge and power.</u>

- This claim develops Foucault’s basic insight that <u>changes in thought are not due to thought itself</u>, suggesting that <u>when thoughts change the causes are <mark>the social forces that control the behaviour of individuals</mark>.</u> 

- Specifically, given Foucault’s archaeological view of knowledge, <u>power transforms the fundamental archaeological frameworks ([[Episteme|epistemes]] or discursive formations) that underlie our knowledge.</u>

- Foucault is here staking out a position between the extremes of:

	1. Reducing knowledge to power (that is, the identification of ‘A knows that p’ with  ‘social forces compel A to accept p’).

	2. Asserting the essential independence of knowledge and power (that is, the Utopian claim that ‘A knows that p’ implies ‘A’s acceptance of p is causally independent of all social forces’).

	- <u>To know is not simply to be affected by power;</u> as Foucault once said of power and knowledge, ‘The very fact that I pose the question of their relation proves clearly that I do not identify them’ (<span class="title">Critical Theory/Intellectual History’</span>). <u>On the other hand, knowing does not involve a total escape from power relations.</u>
