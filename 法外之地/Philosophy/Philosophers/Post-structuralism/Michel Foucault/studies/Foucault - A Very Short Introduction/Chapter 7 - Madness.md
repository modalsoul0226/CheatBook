##  Quaker Asylum

- [[Samuel Tuke|Tuke]]’s work, for example, had religious and moral, not scientific, motivations.

	- The Retreat freed the mad from chains and physical abuse and placed them in a halcyon setting.

	- But in this setting they were strictly monitored for any deviations from conventional behaviour. <u>The therapy consisted in making the madman ‘feel morally responsible for everything in him that may disturb morality and society, and must hold no one but himself responsible’</u> (<span class="title">Madness and Culture</span>, 246).

- The upshot was that ‘Tuke created an asylum where he substituted for the free terror of madness the stifling anguish of responsibility’ (<span class="title">Madness and Culture</span>, 247).

## Moral Imprisonment

-  Foucault resists the picture of Tuke and Pinel as humanitarians because he rejects their view that <u>‘humanity’ entails the values of modern bourgeois society</u>: ‘Now the asylum must represent the great continuity of social morality. <u>The values of family and work, all the acknowledged virtues, now reign in the asylum</u>’ (<span class="title">Madness and Culture</span>, 257), which Foucault insists ‘is not a free realm of observation, diagnosis, and therapeutics’ but ‘<mark>a juridical space where one is accused, judged and condemned</mark>’.

-  The mad are freed from their chains but they are ‘imprisoned in a moral world’ (<span class="title">Madness and Culture</span>, 269). There is a ‘gigantic moral imprisonment’ that, Foucault sneers, ‘<u>we are in the habit of calling</u>, doubtless by antiphrasis, <u>the liberation of the insane</u>’ (<span class="title">Madness and Culture</span>, 278).

## The Paradigm Shift of Madness

- The modern therapeutic view of madness is a sharp break with the Classical view, what Foucault later calls a change in [[Episteme|episteme]] or discursive formation.

	- The mad are returned to the human community, no longer animals beyond the human pale.

	- But, within that community, the mad are now moral offenders (violators of specific social norms), who should feel guilt at their condition and need reform of their attitudes and behaviour.

- Correspondingly, the characteristic modern mode of treating the mad not only isolates them but subjects them to a moralizing therapy. <u>Still, this move from the custodial confinement of the Classical Age to the modern therapeutic asylum continues to deny madness as a humanly significant challenge.</u>

## Moral Authority

- Foucault claims that, in the asylum, the rule is never so much by medical as by moral authority.

- <u>Doctors</u> have authority not because they have the knowledge to cure (this is haphazard at best) but because they <u>represent the moral demands of society.</u>

	- Identification (of madness as mental illness) was, on the contrary, <u>introduced as a means of legitimating the authority of physicians in the asylum</u> once the idea of a distinctively moral therapy was abandoned.

## Doctor–Patient

- Foucault agrees that [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] eliminates most features of the asylum, retaining only <u>the core relation of doctor to patient</u>. But, as we’ve seen, this relation <u>is at the heart of the modern domination of the mad</u>.

- The analyst does listen to the patient but, silent behind the couch, is transformed into ‘an absolute Observation, a pure and circumspect Silence, a Judge who punishes and rewards in a judgment that does not even condescend to language’.

- As a result, <u>[[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalysis]] ‘has not been able, will not be able, to hear the voices of unreason’. It is effective in some cases but, in the end, ‘remains a stranger to the sovereign enterprise of unreason’</u> (<span class="title">Madness and Culture</span>, 278).

## Madness in itself

- Foucault suggests that his is <u>a history ‘of madness’ in the sense of a subjective</u>, not an objective genitive; that, in other words, he is somehow writing from the standpoint of the mad themselves, not just showing how the mad have been perceived by the sane.

	- In fact, the six hundred pages between the preface and the conclusion deal almost exclusively with the latter perception. But we should not let this quantitative imbalance obscure the fact that <u>‘madness in itself ’ is a central presence in this book</u>.

- Foucault insists on this presence because, at this stage, he is writing in opposition to the [[Enlightenment]]. Like [[Horkheimer]] and [[Adorno]] (in their <span class="title">[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]</span> some 20 years earlier), he has realized that<u> the reason that was supposed to liberate us has itself become the primary instrument of our domination.</u>

- The violent sarcasm of his rhetoric is a direct assault on the pretensions of reason, and his heroization of the mad aims to set up an alternative to the regime of reason. This alternative is <mark>the irrationally transgressive experience</mark> lived by the mad and evoked in the works of mad artists.
