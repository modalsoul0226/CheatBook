## Mise-en-scene
All of the elements placed in front of the camera to be photographed: the ***settings*** and ***props***, ***lighting***, ***costumes*** and ***makeup***, ***figure behavior*** and ***shot composition***.

---
### Setting
**Deep space** - An arrangement of mise-en-scene elements so that there is a considerable distance between the plane closest to the camera and the one farthest away. Any or all of these planes may be in focus. See also shallow space.

**Shallow space** - Staging the action in relatively few planes of depth; the opposite of deep space.

**Monochromatic color design** - Color design that emphasizes a narrow set of shades of a single color.

---
### Lighting

**Three-point lighting** - A common arrangement using three directions of light on a scene: from behind the subjects (backlighting), from one bright source (key light), and from a less bright source balancing the key light (fill light).

  - **Key light** - In the three-point lighting system, the brightest illumination coming into the scene. See also backlighting, fill light, three-point lighting.

  - **Fill light** - Illumination from a source less bright than the [key light](#lighting), used to soften deep shadows in a scene. See also [three-point lighting](#lighting).

  - **Side lighting (sidelight)** - Lighting coming from one side of a person or an object, usually to create a sense of volume, to bring out surface tensions, or to fill in areas left shadowed by light from another source.


**Highkey lighting** - Illumination that creates comparatively little contrast between the light and dark areas of the shot. Shadows are fairly transparent and brightened by fill light.

**Low-key lighting** - Illumination that creates strong contrast between light and dark areas of the shot, with deep shadows and little fill light.

**Backlighting** - Illumination cast onto the figures in the scene from the side opposite the camera, usually creating a thin outline of highlighting on those figures.

**Frontal lighting** - Illumination directed into the scene from a posi- tion near the camera.

**Top lighting** - Lighting coming from above a person or an object, usually in order to outline the upper areas of the figure or to separate it more clearly from the background.

**Underlighting** - Illumination from a point below the figures in the scene.

---
### Figure behaviour
**Frontal** - In staging, the positioning of figures so that they face the viewer.

**Overlap** - A cue for suggesting represented depth in the film image by placing objects partly in front of more distant ones.

**Screen direction** - The right–left relationships in a scene, set up in an establishing shot and determined by the position of characters and objects in the frame, by the directions of movement, and by the characters’ eyelines. Continuity editing will attempt to keep screen direction consistent between shots.

---
### Shot composition
**Canted framing** - A view in which the frame is not level; either the right or the left side is lower than the other, causing objects in the scene to appear slanted out of an upright position.

**Framing** - The use of the edges of the film frame to select and to compose what will be visible onscreen.

**Mask** - An opaque screen placed in the camera or printer that blocks part of the frame off and changes the shape of the photographed image, leaving part of the frame a solid color. As seen on the screen, most masks are black, although they can be white or colored.

## Cinematography
A general term for all the manipulations of the film strip by the camera in the shooting phase and by the laboratory in the developing phase.

**Framing**
- **Close-up (CU)** - A framing in which the scale of the object shown is relatively large; most commonly, a person’s head seen from the neck up, or an object of a comparable size that fills most of the screen.

- **Extreme close-up (XCU)** - A framing in which the scale of the object shown is very large; most commonly, a small object or a part of the body.

- **Medium close-up (MCU)** - A framing in which the scale of the object shown is fairly large; a human figure seen from the chest up would fill most of the screen.

- **Medium shot (MS)** - A framing in which the scale of the object shown is of moderate size; a human figure seen from the waist up would fill most of the screen.

- **Long shot (LS)** - A framing in which the scale of the object shown is small; a standing human figure would appear nearly the height of the screen.

- **Medium long shot (MLS)** - A framing at a distance that makes an object about 4 or 5 feet high appear to fill most of the screen vertically. Also known as plan américain, the special term for a medium long shot depicting human figures.

- **Extreme long shot (XLS)** - A framing in which the scale of the object shown is very small; a building, landscape, or crowd of people will fill the screen.

**Movement**
- **Pan** - A camera movement with the camera body turning to the right or left. On the screen, it produces a mobile framing that scans the space horizontally.

- **Whip pan** - An extremely fast movement of the camera from side to side, which briefly causes the image to blur into a set of indistinct horizontal streaks. Often an imperceptible cut joins two whip pans to create a trick transition between scenes.

- **Tilt** - A camera movement with the camera body swiveling upward or downward on a stationary support. It produces a mobile framing that scans the space vertically.

- **Crane shot** - A shot with a change in framing accomplished by placing the camera above the subject and moving through the air in any direction.

- **Dolly** - A camera support with wheels, used in making *tracking shots*.

- **Tracking shot** - A mobile framing that travels through space forward, backward, or laterally. See also crane shot, pan, and tilt.

**Shot**
- **Establishing shot** - A shot, usually involving a distant framing, that shows the spatial relations among the important figures, objects, and setting in a scene.

- **Reestablishing shot** - A return to a view of an entire space after a series of closer shots following the establishing shot.

- **Point-of-view shot** - A shot taken with the camera placed approximately where the character’s eyes would be, showing what the character would see; usually cut in before or after a shot of the character looking.

**Canted framing** - A view in which the frame is not level; either the right or the left side is lower than the other, causing objects in the scene to appear slanted out of an upright position.

**Contrast** - In cinematography, the difference between the brightest and the darkest areas within the frame.

**Focus** - The degree to which light rays coming from the same part of an object through different parts of the lens reconverge at the same point on the film frame, creating sharp outlines and distinct textures.

**Deep focus** - A use of the camera lens and lighting that keeps objects in both close and distant planes in sharp focus.

**Depth of field** - The measurements of the closest and farthest planes in front of the camera lens between which everything will be in sharp focus. A depth of field from 5 to 16 feet, for example, would mean everything closer than 5 feet and farther than 16 feet would be out of focus.

**Exposure** - The adjustment of the camera mechanism in order to control how much light strikes each frame of film passing through the aperture.

**Focal length** - The distance from the center of the lens to the point at which the light rays meet in sharp focus. The focal length determines the perspective relations of the space represented on the flat screen.

**Long take** - A shot that continues for an unusually lengthy time before the transition to the next shot.

## Editing
(1) In filmmaking, the task of selecting and joining camera takes. (2) In the finished film, the set of techniques that governs the relations among shots.

**Constructive editing** - A framing in which the scale of the object shown is relatively large; most commonly, a person’s head seen from the neck up, or an object of a comparable size that fills most of the screen.

**Continuity editing** - A system of cutting to maintain continuous and clear narrative action. Continuity editing relies on matching screen direction, position, and temporal relations from shot to shot. For specific techniques of continuity editing, see axis of action, [crosscutting](#editing), cut-in, establishing shot, eyeline match, match on action, reestablishing shot, screen direction, shot/reverse shot.

**Elliptical editing** - Shot transitions that omit parts of an event, causing an ellipsis in plot duration.

**Overlapping editing** - Cuts that repeat part or all of an action, thus expanding its viewing time and plot duration.
<br/>
**Cheat cut** - In the continuity editing system, a cut that presents con- tinuous time from shot to shot but that mismatches the positions of figures or objects.

**Crosscutting** - Editing that alternates shots of two or more lines of action occurring in different places, usually simultaneously.

**Jump cut** - An elliptical cut that appears to be an interruption of a single shot. Either the figures seem to change instantly against a constant background, or the background changes instantly while the figures remain constant.
<br/>
**Eyeline match** - A cut obeying the axis of action principle, in which the first shot shows a person looking off in one direction and the second shows a nearby space containing what he or she sees. If the person looks left, the following shot should imply that the looker is offscreen right.

**Graphic match** - Two successive shots joined so as to create a strong similarity of compositional elements (e.g., color, shape).

**Match on action** - A continuity cut that splices two different views of the same action together at the same moment in the movement, making it seem to continue uninterrupted.
<br/>
**Nondiegetic insert** - A shot or series of shots cut into a sequence, showing objects that are represented as being outside the world of the narrative.

**Dialogue overlapping** - In editing a scene, arranging the cut so that a bit of dialogue coming from shot A is heard under a shot that shows another character or another element in the scene.

**Racking focus** - Shifting the area of sharp focus from one plane to another during a shot; the effect on the screen is called rack-focus.

**Shot/reverse shot** - Two or more shots edited together that alternate characters, typically in a conversation situation. In continuity editing, characters in one framing usually look left; in the other framing, right. Over-the-shoulder framings are common in shot/reverse-shot editing.
<br/>
**Montage sequence** - A segment of a film that summarizes a topic or compresses a passage of time into brief symbolic or typical images. Frequently, dissolves, fades, superimpositions, and wipes are used to link the images in a montage sequence.

**Fade-in** - A dark screen that gradually brightens as a shot appears.

**Fade-out** - A shot that gradually disappears as the screen darkens. Occasionally, fade-outs brighten to pure white or to a color.

**Iris** - A round, moving mask that can close down to end a scene (iris-out) or emphasize a detail, or that can open to begin a scene (iris-in) or to reveal more space around a detail.

**Dissolve** - A transition between two shots during which the first image gradually disappears while the second image gradually appears; for a moment, the two images blend in superimposition.

**Wipe** - A transition between shots in which a line passes across the screen, eliminating one shot as it goes and replacing it with the next one.

## Sound

**Asynchronous sound** - Sound that is not matched temporally with the movements occurring in the image, as when dialogue is out of synchronization with lip movements.

**Synchronous sound** - Sound that is matched temporally with the movements occurring in the images, as when dialogue corresponds to lip movements.

**Simultaneous sound** - Diegetic sound that is represented as occurring at the same time in the story as the image it accompanies.

**Nonsimultaneous sound** - Diegetic sound that comes from a source in time either earlier or later than the images it accompanies.
<br/>
**Diegetic sound** - Any voice, musical passage, or sound effect presented as originating from a source within the film’s world. See also nondiegetic sound.

**Nondiagetic sound** - Sound, such as mood music or a narrator’s commentary, represented as coming from a source outside the space of the narrative.
<br/>
**External diegetic sound** - Sound represented as coming from a physical source within the story space that we assume characters in the scene also hear. See also [internal diegetic sound]().

**Internal diegetic sound** - Sound represented as coming from the mind of a character within the story space. Although we and the character can hear it, we assume that the other characters cannot.
<br/>
**Fidelity** - The degree to which a film adaptation remains faithful to either the narrative details or the spirit of its source material.

**Mixing** - Combining two or more sound tracks by recording them onto a single one.

**Sound bridge** - (1) At the beginning of one scene, the sound from the previous scene carries over briefly before the sound from the new scene begins. (2) At the end of one scene, the sound from the next scene is heard, leading into that scene.

**Sound perspective** - The sense of a sound’s position in space, yielded by volume, timbre, pitch, and, in stereophonic reproduction systems, binaural information.


---
## Narrative
The process through which the plot conveys or withholds story information. The narration can be more or less restricted to character knowledge and more or less deep in presenting characters’ perceptions and thoughts.

**Duration** - In a narrative film, the aspect of temporal manipulation that involves the time span presented in the [plot](#Narrative) and assumed to operate in the [story](). See also [frequency](), [order]().

**Story** - In a narrative film, all the events that we see and hear, plus all those that we infer or assume to have occurred, arranged in their presumed causal relations, chronological order, duration, frequency, and spatial locations; opposed to plot, which is the film’s actual presentation of events in the story. See also duration, ellipsis, frequency, order, space, viewing time.

**Frequency** - In a narrative film, the aspect of temporal manipulation that involves the number of times any story event is shown in the plot.

**Order** - In a narrative film, the aspect of temporal manipulation that involves the sequence in which the chronological events of the story are arranged in the plot. See also duration, frequency.

**Plot** - In a narrative film, all the events that are directly presented to us, including their causal relations, chronological order, duration, frequency, and spatial locations; opposed to story, which is the viewer’s imaginary construction of all the events in the narrative.

**Style** - The repeated and salient uses of film techniques characteristic of a single film or a group of films (for example, a filmmaker’s work or a national movement).

**Fidelity** - The degree to which a film adaptation remains faithful to either the narrative details or the spirit of its source material.

**Flashforward** - An alteration of story order in which the plot presentation moves forward to future events and then returns to the present.
