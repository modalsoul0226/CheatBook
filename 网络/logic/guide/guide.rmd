# Aristotle 亚里士多德 (384 ~ 322 B.C.)

The rise of modern formal logic following the work of Frege and Russell brought with it a recognition of the many serious limitations of Aristotle’s logic.

However, Aristotle shares with modern logicians a fundamental interest in metatheory:

- His primary goal is not to offer a practical guide to argumentation but to study \buwave{the properties of inferential systems} themselves.

## Deduction

All Aristotle's logic revolves around **deduction** (συλλογισμός).

A deduction is **speech** ({\greekfont λόγος}) in which, certain things having been supposed, something different from those supposed results of necessity because of their being so. (\textit{Prior Analytics} I.2, 24b19-20)

## The Organon

Aristotle's logical works, called the **Orgranon** are the earliest formal study of logic that have come down to modern times:

- **The Categories** 范畴篇, a study of the ten kinds of primitive terms.
- **On Interpretation** 解释篇, an analysis of simple **categorical propositions** into simple terms, negation, and signs of quantity.
- **The Prior Analytics** 前分析篇, a formal analysis of what makes a **syllogism**.
- **The Posterior Analytics** 后分析篇, a study of **scientific demonstration**, containing Aristotle's mature views on logic.
- **The Topics** 论辩篇, a discussion of **dialectics**.
- **On Sphistical Refutations** 辩谬篇

## The Square of Opposition

The square of opposition is a group of theses embodied in a diagram.
The theses concern logical relations among four logical forms:

|Name|Form|Title|
|:--:|:--:|:----|
|**A**|Every $S$ is $P$|Universal Affirmative|
|**E**|No $S$ is $P$|Universal Negative|
|**I**|Some $S$ is $P$|Particular Affirmative|
|**O**|Some $S$ is not $P$|Particular Negative|

\[\begin{tikzcd}
	{\text{Every S is P}} & {\textbf{A}} &&&& {\textbf{E}} & {\text{No S is P}} \\
	\\
	&&& {\text{contradictories}} \\
	\\
	{\text{Some S is P}} & {\textbf{I}} &&&& {\textbf{O}} & {\text{Some S is not P}}
	\arrow[no head, from=1-2, to=3-4]
	\arrow[no head, from=3-4, to=1-6]
	\arrow["{\text{subalterns}}"{description}, from=1-2, to=5-2]
	\arrow["{\text{subalterns}}"{description}, from=1-6, to=5-6]
	\arrow["{\text{subcontraries}}"{description}, no head, from=5-2, to=5-6]
	\arrow[no head, from=5-2, to=3-4]
	\arrow[no head, from=5-6, to=3-4]
	\arrow["{\text{contraries}}"{description}, no head, from=1-2, to=1-6]
\end{tikzcd}\]

# Chrysippus (279 ~ 206 B.C.)

Aristotelian logic was what was transmitted to the Arabic and the Latin medieval traditions, while the works of Chrysippus have not survived.
